This operating system is not supported\nfor a production deployment of Cloudbreak.\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nMake sure that you opened the following ports:\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nCloudbreak API (8080)\n\n\nIdentity server (8089)\n\n\nCloudbreak GUI (3000)\n\n\nUser authentication (3001)\n\n\n\n\nExecute every command as \nroot\n. In order to get root privileges execute:\n\n\nsudo -i\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that your system is up-to-date and reboot it if necessary (for example, if there was a kernel update):\n\n\nyum -y update\n\n\n\n\nInstall iptables-services. Without iptables-services installed the 'iptables save' command will not be available:\n\n\nyum -y install iptables-services net-tools\n\n\n\n\nThen, configure permissive iptables on your machine:\n\n\niptables --flush INPUT \n \\\niptables --flush FORWARD \n \\\nservice iptables save\n\n\n\n\nConfigure a custom Docker repository for installing the correct version of Docker:\n\n\ncat \n /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo \nEOF\n\n[dockerrepo]\nname=Docker Repository\nbaseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/7\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg\nEOF\n\n\n\n\nNext, install the Docker service:\n\n\nyum install -y docker-engine-1.9.1 docker-engine-selinux-1.9.1\nsystemctl start docker\nsystemctl enable docker\n\n\n\n\nInstall Cloudbreak Deployer\n\n\nInstall the Cloudbreak Deployer and unzip the platform-specific single binary to your PATH.

If \ncbd\n did not get the IP address during the initialization, set the appropriate value.\n\n\nGenerate Your Profile\n\n\nYou are done with the configuration of Cloudbreak Deployer. The last thing you have to do is to generate the configurations by executing:\n\n\nrm *.yml\ncbd generate\n\n\n\n\nThis step creates the following configurations:\n\n\n\n\nCreates the \ndocker-compose.yml\n file that describes the configuration of all the Docker containers needed for the Cloudbreak deployment.\n\n\nCreates the \nuaa.yml\n file that holds the configuration of the identity server used to authenticate users to Cloudbreak.\n\n\n\n\nStart Cloudbreak\n\n\nTo start the Cloudbreak application use the following command:\n\n\ncbd pull\ncbd start\n\n\n\n\nThis will start all the Docker containers and initialize the application. It will take a few minutes for all the services to start.\n\n\n\n\nThe first time you start the Coudbreak app, the process will take longer than usual due to the download of all the necessary docker images.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the \ncbd start\n command finishes, use this command to check the logs of the Cloudbreak application:\n\n\ncbd logs cloudbreak\n\n\n\n\nYou should see a message like this in the log: \nStarted CloudbreakApplication in 36.823 seconds\n. Cloudbreak normally takes less than a minute to start. \n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf you are faced with permission or connection issues, try to disable \nSELinux\n:\n\n\n\n\nSet the \nSELINUX=disabled\n in \n/etc/selinux/config\n\n\nReboot the machine\n\n\nEnsure the SELinux is not turned on afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nsetenforce 0 \n sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nAfter you have met all the pre-requisites for Cloudbreak, perform the \ncloud provider specific\n configuration.

Go to your \nAWS Management Console\n to launch the latest Cloudbreak Deployer image in your region.  \n\n\n\n\nAs an alternative to using the pre-built cloud images for AWS, you can install Cloudbreak Deployer on your own VM. For more information, see \ninstallation page\n.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that you have opened the following ports on your \nsecurity group\n:\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nCloudbreak API (8080)\n\n\nIdentity server (8089)\n\n\nCloudbreak UI (3000)\n\n\nUser authentication (3001)\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak Deployer AWS Image Details\n\n\n\n\nMinimum and Recommended VM requirements\n:\n 8GB RAM, 10GB disk, 2 cores. \nThe minimum instance type which is suitable for Cloudbreak is \nm3.large\n.\nTo learn about all requirements, see **\nMinimum and Recommended VM requirements\n.\n\n\n\n\nAWS Setup\n\n\nBefore configuring Cloudbreak Deployer, you should know that:\n\n\n\n\nThe default SSH username for the EC2 instances is \ncloudbreak\n.\n\n\nCloudbreak Deployer location on your EC2 instance is \n/var/lib/cloudbreak-deployment\n. This is the\n  \ncbd\n root folder.\n\n\nYou must execute all \ncbd\n actions from the \ncbd\n root folder as a \ncloudbreak\n user.\n\n\n\n\nSet up Cloudbreak Deployer\n\n\nYou should have already installed the Cloudbreak Deployer either \nusing the AWS Cloud Images\n or by \ninstalling the\nCloudbreak Deployer\n manually on your own VM.\n\n\nYou can \nconnect to the previously created \ncbd\n VM\n.\n\n\nTo open the \ncloudbreak-deployment\n directory, run:\n\n\ncd /var/lib/cloudbreak-deployment/\n\n\n\n\nThis directory contains configuration files and the supporting binaries for Cloudbreak Deployer.\n\n\nConfiguring Role-based Credentials\n\n\nThere are two ways to create AWS credentials in Cloudbreak:\n\n\nKey-based:\n This requires your AWS access key and secret key pair. Cloudbreak will use these keys to launch the resources. For starters, this is a simpler option that does not require additional configuration. You will provide the keys later when you \nprovision an HDP cluster\n.\n\n\nRole-based:\n This requires a valid \nIAM role\n with \"AssumeRole\" policy. Cloudbreak will assume this role to get temporary access and the access/secret key pair.\n\n\nTo configure role-based credentials, start your instance with an \"AssumeRole\" policy. For more information, see \nUsing Instance Profiles\n and \nUsing an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications Running on Amazon EC2 Instances\n.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can set your AWS keys of an IAM user with an\"AssumeRole\" policy in the \nProfile\n file:\n\n\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA**************W7SA\n  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=RWCT4Cs8******************/*skiOkWD\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use instance profile, do not set these variables. If you want to use Cloudbreak with Role ARNs instead of keys, make sure that the instance profile role can assume roles on AWS.\n\n\n\n\nStart Cloudbreak Deployer\n\n\nTo start the Cloudbreak application use the following command:\n\n\ncbd start\n\n\n\n\nThis will start all the Docker containers and initialize the application.\n\n\n\n\nThe first time you start the Coudbreak app, the process will take longer than usual due to the download of all the necessary docker images.\n\n\n\n\nThe \ncbd start\n command includes the \ncbd generate\n command which applies the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreates the \ndocker-compose.yml\n file that describes the configuration of all the Docker containers needed for the Cloudbreak deployment.\n\n\nCreates the \nuaa.yml\n file that holds the configuration of the identity server used to authenticate users to Cloudbreak.\n\n\n\n\nValidate that Cloudbreak Deployer Has Started\n\n\nAfter the \ncbd start\n command finishes, check the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-installed Cloudbreak Deployer version and health:\n   \ncbd doctor\n\n\n\n\nIn case \ncbd update\n is needed, check the documentation for \nCloudbreak Deployer Update\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak Application logs:\n   \ncbd logs cloudbreak\n\n  You should see a message like this in the log: \nStarted CloudbreakApplication in 36.823 seconds\n. Cloudbreak normally takes less than a minute to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Configurations\n\n\nYou can perform the following optional comnfigurations:\n\n\nSet Custom Tags**\n\n\nIn order to differentiate launched instances, we give you the option to use custom tags on your AWS resources deployed by Cloudbreak. You can use the tagging mechanism with the following variables. \n\n\nIf you want just one custom tag on your Cloudformation resources, set this variable :\n\n\nexport CB_AWS_DEFAULT_CF_TAG=whatever\n\n\n\n\nThen the name of the tag will be \nCloudbreakId\n and the value will be \nwhatever\n.\n\n\nIf you need more specific tagging, set this variable:\n\n\nexport CB_AWS_CUSTOM_CF_TAGS=myveryspecifictag:veryspecific\n\n\n\n\nThen the name of the tag will be \nmyveryspecifictag\n and the value will be \nveryspecific\n. You can specify a list of tags here with a comma separated list; for example: \ntag1:value1,tag2:value2,tag3:value3\n.\n\n\nProvisioning Prerequisites\n\n\nIAM role setup\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use your Aws Access Key and your Secret Access Key to authenticate to Amazon then please use the \nKey based authentication\n and you do not need to setup an IAM Role.\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak works by connecting your AWS account through so called \nCredentials\n, and then uses these credentials to \ncreate resources on your behalf.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Cloudbreak deployment uses two different AWS accounts for two different purposes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe account belonging to the \nCloudbreak webapp\n itself, acts as a \nthird party\n, that creates resources on the \naccount of the \nend user\n. This account is configured at server-deployment time.\n\n\nThe account belonging to the \nend user\n who uses the UI or the Shell to create clusters. This account is configured\n when setting up credentials.\n\n\n\n\nThese accounts are usually \nthe same\n when the end user is the same who deployed the Cloudbreak server, but it allows\n Cloudbreak to act as a SaaS project as well if needed.\n\n\nCredentials use \nIAM Roles\n to give access to the \nthird party to act on behalf of the end user without giving full access to your resources.\nThis IAM Role will be \nassumed\n later by an IAM user.\n\n\nAWS IAM Policy that grants permission to assume a role\n\n\nYou cannot assume a role with root account\n, so you need to \ncreate an IAM user\n with an attached \nInline\n \npolicy\n and \nthen set the \nAccess key and Secret Access key\n in the \n\nProfile\n file (check \nthis description\n out).\n\n\nThe \nsts-assume-role\n IAM user \npolicy\n must be configured to have \npermission to assume roles on all resources. Here it is the policy to configure the \nsts:AssumeRole\n for all \n\nResource\n:\n\n\n{\n\u2002\u2002\nVersion\n: \n2012-10-17\n,\n\u2002\u2002\nStatement\n: [\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002{\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\nSid\n: \nStmt1400068149000\n,\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\nEffect\n: \nAllow\n,\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\nAction\n: [\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\nsts:AssumeRole\n\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002],\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\nResource\n: [\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\n*\n\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002]\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002}\n\u2002\u2002]\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo connect your (\nend user\n) AWS account with a credential in Cloudbreak you'll have to create an IAM role on your \nAWS account that is configured to allow the third-party account to access and create resources on your behalf.\nThe easiest way to do this is with \ncbd\n commands (but it can also be done manually from the \nAWS Console\n):\n\n\ncbd aws generate-role  - Generates an AWS IAM role for Cloudbreak provisioning on AWS\ncbd aws show-role      - Show assumers and policies for an AWS role\ncbd aws delete-role    - Deletes an AWS IAM role, removes all inline policies\n\n\n\n\nThe \ngenerate-role\n command creates a role that is assumable by the Cloudbreak Deployer AWS account and has a broad policy setup.\nThis command creates a role with the name \ncbreak-deployer\n by default. If you'd like to create role with a different\n name or multiple roles, you need to add this line to your \nProfile\n:\n\n\nexport AWS_ROLE_NAME=my-cloudbreak-role\n\n\n\n\nYou can check the generated role on your AWS console, under IAM roles:\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nGenerate a new SSH key\n\n\nAll the instances created by Cloudbreak are configured to allow key-based SSH,\nso you'll need to provide an SSH public key that can be used later to SSH onto the instances in the clusters you'll create with Cloudbreak.\nYou can use one of your existing keys or you can generate a new one.\n\n\nTo generate a new SSH keypair:\n\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \nyour_email@example.com\n\n# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label\n# Generating public/private rsa key pair.\n\n\n\n\n# Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]\nYou'll be asked to enter a passphrase, but you can leave it empty.\n\n# Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]\n# Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\n\n\n\n\nAfter you enter a passphrase the keypair is generated. The output should look something like below.\n\n\n# Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.\n# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\n# The key fingerprint is:\n# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:sd:17:sd:7d:sd:68:9d:sd:a2:sd your_email@example.com\n\n\n\n\nLater you'll need to pass the \n.pub\n file's contents to Cloudbreak and use the private part to SSH to the instances\n\n\nProvisioning via Browser\n\n\nYou can log into the Cloudbreak application at \nhttp://\nPublic_IP\n:3000/\n.\n\n\nThe main goal of the Cloudbreak UI is to easily create clusters on your own cloud provider account.\nThis description details the AWS setup - if you'd like to use a different cloud provider check out its manual.\n\n\nThis document explains the four steps that need to be followed to create Cloudbreak clusters from the UI:\n\n\n\n\nconnect your AWS account with Cloudbreak\n\n\ncreate some template resources on the UI that describe the infrastructure of your clusters\n\n\ncreate a blueprint that describes the HDP services in your clusters\n\n\nlaunch the cluster itself based on these resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Make sure that you have sufficient qouta (CPU, network, etc) for the requested cluster size\n\n\n\n\nSetting up AWS credentials\n\n\nCloudbreak works by connecting your AWS account through so called \nCredentials\n, and then uses these credentials to \ncreate resources on your behalf. The credentials can be configured on the \nmanage credentials\n panel on the \nCloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\nTo create a new AWS credential follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the credential type. For instance, select the \nRole Based\n\n\nFill out the new credential \nName\n\n\nOnly alphanumeric and lowercase characters (min 5, max 100 characters) can be applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy your AWS IAM role's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the \nIAM Role ARN\n field\n\n\nCopy your SSH public key to the \nSSH public key\n field\n\n\nThe SSH public key must be in OpenSSH format and it's private keypair can be used later to \nSSH onto every \ninstance\n of every cluster you'll create with this credential.\n\n\nThe \nSSH username\n for the EC2 instances is \ncloudbreak\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny other parameter is optional here.\n\n\nPublic in account\n means that all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this credential to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nInfrastructure templates\n\n\nAfter your AWS account is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating resource templates that describe your clusters' infrastructure:\n\n\n\n\ntemplates\n\n\nnetworks\n\n\nsecurity groups\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create one of the above resource, \nCloudbreak does not make any requests to AWS. Resources are only created\n on AWS after the \ncreate cluster\n button has pushed.\n These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \n reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTemplates describe the \ninstances of your cluster\n - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.\n\n\nThe instance templates can be configured on the \nmanage templates\n panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\nThere are some optional configurations here as well:\n\n\n\n\nSpot price (USD)\n If specified Cloudbreak will request spot price instances (which might take a while or never be \nfulfilled by Amazon). \nThis option is \nnot supported\n by the default RedHat images\n.\n\n\nEBS encryption\n is supported for all volume types. If this option is checked then all the attached disks \nwill be encrypted\n by Amazon using the AWS KMS master keys.\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNetworks\n\n\nYour clusters can be created in their own \nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC)\n or in one of your already existing VPCs.\nIf you choose an existing VPC it is possible to create a new subnet within the VPC or use an already existing one.\nThe subnet's IP range must be defined in the \nSubnet (CIDR)\n field using the general CIDR notation.\n\n\nDefault AWS Network\n\n\nIf you don't want to create or use your custom VPC, you can use the \ndefault-aws-network\n for all your\nCloudbreak clusters. It will create a new VPC with a \n10.0.0.0/16\n subnet every time a cluster is created.\n\n\nCustom AWS Network\n\n\nIf you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom VPC you'll have to \ncreate a new network\n template on the \nmanage\nnetworks\n panel.\n\n\nYou have the following options:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new VPC and a new subnet\n: Every time a cluster is created with this kind of network setup a new VPC and a new subnet with the specified IP range will be created for the instances on AWS.\n\n\nCreate a new subnet in an existing VPC\n:  Use this kind of network setup if you already have a VPC on AWS where you'd like to put the Cloudbreak created cluster but you'd like to have a separate subnet for it. This setup is only supported for basic VPCs, where an Internet Gateway is configured and instances can have public IP addresses to access the Internet. If you have a specific VPC setup (VGW, NAT, private subnets, etc..) then only the third option can be used.\n\n\nUse an existing subnet in an existing VPC\n:  Use this kind of network setup if you have an existing VPC with one or more subnets on AWS and you'd like to start the instances of a cluster in one of those subnets. Use this setup if you have a specific VPC setup: you should first create the subnet(s) where you'd like to install your clusters directly through AWS and provide their IDs here. In this case there are only 2 requirements for the subnets:\n\n\ninstances in the subnet should be able to reach the Internet to download yum packages (it can be done through a Virtual Gateway, a NAT instance, an Internet Gateway or any other setup)\n\n\nthe VM where Cloudbreak is deployed must be able to reach the instances in the cluster on port 443. (It\u2019s in the same subnet, or through a router from another subnet)\n\n\nNOTE\n: instances in the subnet doesn't need to have public IP addresses in this case\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure the \nSubnet Identifier\n and the \nInternet Gateway Identifier\n (IGW) of your VPC.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n The subnet CIDR cannot overlap each other in a VPC. So you have to create different network\ntemplates for every each clusters.\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new subnet within the VPC, provide the ID of the subnet which is in the existing VPC and your cluster\nwill be launched into that subnet. \nFor example\n you can create 3 different clusters with 3 different network\ntemplates for multiple subnets \n10.0.0.0/24\n, \n10.0.1.0/24\n, \n10.0.2.0/24\n with the same VPC and IGW identifiers.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Please make sure the define subnet here doesn't overlap with any of your already deployed subnet in\nthe VPC, because of the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.\n\n\nIn case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template\nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The VPCs, IGWs and subnet are created on AWS only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected\nnetwork template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nSecurity groups\n\n\nSecurity group templates are very similar to the \nsecurity groups on the AWS Console\n.\n\nThey describe the allowed inbound traffic to the instances in the cluster.\n\nCurrently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster and all the instances have a \npublic IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security group.\nThis may change in a later release.\n\n\nDefault Security Group\n\n\nYou can also use the two pre-defined security groups in Cloudbreak.\n\n\nonly-ssh-and-ssl:\n all ports are locked down except for SSH and the selected Ambari Server HTTPS (you can't access Hadoop services outside of the VPC):\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nHTTPS (443)\n\n\n\n\nall-services-port:\n all Hadoop services, SSH and HTTPS are accessible by default:\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nHTTPS (443)\n\n\nAmbari (8080)\n\n\nConsul (8500)\n\n\nNN (50070)\n\n\nRM Web (8088)\n\n\nScheduler (8030RM)\n\n\nIPC (8050RM)\n\n\nJob history server (19888)\n\n\nHBase master (60000)\n\n\nHBase master web (60010)\n\n\nHBase RS (16020)\n\n\nHBase RS info (60030)\n\n\nFalcon (15000)\n\n\nStorm (8744)\n\n\nHive metastore (9083)\n\n\nHive server (10000)\n\n\nHive server HTTP (10001)\n\n\nAccumulo master (9999)\n\n\nAccumulo Tserver (9997)\n\n\nAtlas (21000)\n\n\nKNOX (8443)\n\n\nOozie (11000)\n\n\nSpark HS (18080)\n\n\nNM Web (8042)\n\n\nZeppelin WebSocket (9996)\n\n\nZeppelin UI (9995)\n\n\nKibana (3080)\n\n\nElasticsearch (9200)\n\n\n\n\nCustom Security Group\n\n\nYou can define your own security group by adding all the ports, protocols and CIDR range you'd like to use. The rules\n defined here doesn't need to contain the internal rules, those are automatically added by Cloudbreak to the security group on AWS.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n 443 and 22 ports needs to be there in every security group otherwise Cloudbreak won't be able to communicate with the \nprovisioned cluster\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this security group \ntemplate to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The security groups are created on AWS only after the cluster provisioning starts with the selected security group template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nDefining cluster services\n\n\nBlueprints\n\n\nBlueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own ones.\nBlueprints can be added from file, URL (an \nexample blueprint\n) or the \nwhole JSON can be written in the \nJSON text\n box.\n\n\nThe host groups in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster. Besides this the services and\n components will also be installed on the corresponding nodes. Blueprints can be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Not necessary to define all the configuration in the blueprint. If a configuration is missing, Ambari will \nfill that with a default value.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to \ncreate clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight \nmodifications.\n\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the \nmodifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations are hardcoded for example domain names, memory configurations...etc. that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster\n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster.\n\n\nHere is a \nbasic flow for cluster creation on Cloudbreak Web UI\n:\n\n\n\n\nStart by selecting a previously created AWS credential in the header.\n\n\nOpen \ncreate cluster\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Cluster\n tab\n\n\n\n\nFill out the new cluster \nname\n\n\nCluster name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character then you can apply lowercase alphanumeric and \n   hyphens only (min 5, max 40 characters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a \nRegion\n where you like your cluster be provisioned\n\n\nClick on the \nSetup Network and Security\n button\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to see the created cluster on\n the UI, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Network and Security\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the networks\n\n\nSelect one of the security groups\n\n\nClick on the \nChoose Blueprint\n button\n\n\nIf \nEnable security\n is checked as well, Cloudbreak will install Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the cluster will \nbe Kerberized. See more about it in the \nKerberos\n section of this documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Blueprint\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the blueprint\n\n\nAfter you've selected a \nBlueprint\n, you should be able to configure:\n\n\nthe templates\n\n\nthe number of nodes for all of the host groups in the blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to select where you want to install the Ambari server to. Only 1 host group can be selected.\n   If you want to install the Ambari server to a separate node, you need to extend your blueprint with a new host group\n   which contains only 1 service: HDFS_CLIENT and select this host group for the Ambari server. Note: this host group cannot be scaled so \n   it is not advised to select a 'slave' host group for this purpose.\n\n\nClick on the \nReview and Launch\n button\n\n\n\n\nReview and Launch\n tab\n\n\n\n\nAfter the \ncreate and start cluster\n button has clicked Cloudbreak will start to create the cluster's resources on \n your AWS account.\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak uses \nCloudFormation\n to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak on \nthe AWS Console CloudFormation page.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nBesides these you can check the progress on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself if you open the new cluster's \nEvent History\n.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nAdvanced options\n\n\nThere are some advanced features when deploying a new cluster, these are the following:\n\n\nAmbari Username\n This user will be used as admin user in Ambari. You can log in using this username on the Ambari UI.\n\n\nAmbari Password\n The password associated with the Ambari username. This password will be also the default password for all required passwords which are not specified in the blueprint. E.g: hive DB password.\n\n\nAvailability Zone\n You can restrict the instances to a \nspecific availability zone\n. It may be useful if you're using\n reserved instances.\n\n\nUse dedicated instances\n You can use \ndedicated instances\n on EC2\n\n\nMinimum cluster size\n The provisioning strategy in case of the cloud provider cannot allocate all the requested nodes.\n\n\nValidate blueprint\n This is selected by default. Cloudbreak validates the Ambari blueprint in this case.\n\n\nShipyard enabled cluster\n This is selected by default. Cloudbreak will start a \nShipyard\n container which helps you to manage your containers.\n\n\nConfig recommendation strategy\n Strategy for configuration recommendations how will be applied. Recommended \nconfigurations gathered by the response of the stack advisor. \n\n\n\n\nNEVER_APPLY\n               Configuration recommendations are ignored with this option.\n\n\nONLY_STACK_DEFAULTS_APPLY\n Applies only on the default configurations for all included services.\n\n\nALWAYS_APPLY\n              Applies on all configuration properties.\n\n\n\n\nSeamless S3 Access\n Cluster will be able to reach S3 buckets without any configuration.\n\n\n\n\nDisable S3 Access By Default\n               Cluster will not be able to reach S3 buckets.\n\n\nCreate Role For S3 Access\n                  The Cloudformation template will create a new role and assign to every instance.\n\n\nDefine Existing Role For S3 Access\n         Cluster will use the predefined instance role. You should define the role in the \nRole for S3 connection\n box\n\n\n\n\nCluster termination\n\n\nYou can terminate running or stopped clusters with the \nterminate\n button in the cluster details.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster. If that fails for some reason, try to delete the \nCloudFormation stack first. Instances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an instance manually!\n\n\n\n\nSometimes Cloudbreak cannot synchronize it's state with the cluster state at the cloud provider and the cluster can't\n be terminated. In this case the \nForced termination\n option can help to terminate the cluster at the Cloudbreak \n side. \nIf it has happened:\n\n\n\n\nYou should check the related resources at the AWS CloudFormation\n\n\nIf it is needed you need to manually remove resources from there\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nInteractive mode / Cloudbreak Shell\n\n\nThe goal with the Cloudbreak Shell (Cloudbreak CLI) was to provide an interactive command line tool which supports:\n\n\n\n\nall functionality available through the REST API or Cloudbreak Web UI\n\n\nmakes possible complete automation of management task via scripts\n\n\ncontext aware command availability\n\n\ntab completion\n\n\nrequired/optional parameter support\n\n\nhint command to guide you on the usual path\n\n\n\n\nStart Cloudbreak Shell\n\n\nTo start the Cloudbreak CLI use the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nOpen your \ncloudbreak-deployment\n directory if it is needed. For example:\n\n\n\n\n   cd cloudbreak-deployment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the \ncbd\n from here if it is needed\n\n\n\n\n   cbd start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the root of your \ncloudbreak-deployment\n folder apply:\n\n\n\n\n   cbd util cloudbreak-shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the very first time it will take for a while, because of need to download all the necessary docker images.\n\n\n\n\nThis will launch the Cloudbreak shell inside a Docker container then it is ready to use.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT You have to copy all your files into the \ncbd\n working directory, what you would like to use in shell.\n For \nexample if your \ncbd\n working directory is \n~/cloudbreak-deployment\n then copy your \nblueprint JSON, public ssh key \nfile...etc.\n to here. You can refer to these files with their names from the shell.\n\n\n\n\nAutocomplete and hints\n\n\nCloudbreak Shell helps to you with \nhint messages\n from the very beginning, for example:\n\n\ncloudbreak-shell\nhint\nHint: Add a blueprint with the 'blueprint add' command or select an existing one with 'blueprint select'\ncloudbreak-shell\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond this you can use the \nautocompletion (double-TAB)\n as well:\n\n\ncloudbreak-shell\ncredential create --\ncredential create --AWS          credential create --AZURE        credential create --EC2          credential create --GCP          credential create --OPENSTACK\n\n\n\n\nProvisioning via CLI\n\n\nSetting up AWS credential\n\n\nCloudbreak works by connecting your AWS account through so called Credentials, and then uses these credentials to \ncreate resources on your behalf. Credentials can be configured with the following command for example:\n\n\ncredential create --AWS --name my-aws-credential --description \nsample description\n --roleArn \narn:aws:iam::***********:role/userrole --sshKeyString \nssh-rsa AAAAB****etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n that Cloudbreak \ndoes not set your cloud user details\n - we work around the concept of \nIAM\n - \non Amazon (or other cloud providers)\n. You should have already a valid IAM role. You can \nfind further details \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives to provide \nSSH Key\n:\n\n\n\n\nyou can upload your public key from an url: \n\u2014sshKeyUrl\n \n\n\nor you can add the path of your public key: \n\u2014sshKeyPath\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether the credential was created successfully\n\n\ncredential list\n\n\n\n\nYou can switch between your existing credentials\n\n\ncredential select --name my-aws-credential\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure templates\n\n\nAfter your AWS account is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating resource templates that describe your clusters' infrastructure:\n\n\n\n\nsecurity groups\n\n\nnetworks\n\n\ntemplates\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create one of the above resource, \nCloudbreak does not make any requests to AWS. Resources are only created\n on AWS after the \ncluster create\n has applied.\n These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \n reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTemplates describe the \ninstances of your cluster\n - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.\n\n\nA template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a \nnew stack). Templates can be configured with the following command for example:\n\n\ntemplate create --AWS --name my-aws-template --description \nsample description\n --instanceType m4.large --volumeSize \n100 --volumeCount 2\n\n\n\n\nOther available option here is \n--publicInAccount\n. If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able\n to use this template to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the template was created successfully\n\n\ntemplate list\n\n\n\n\nNetworks\n\n\nYour clusters can be created in their own \nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC)\n or in one of your already existing VPCs. If \nyou choose an existing VPC it is possible to create a new subnet within the VPC or use an already existing one. The \nsubnet's IP range must be defined in the \nSubnet (CIDR)\n field using the general CIDR notation.\n\n\nDefault AWS Network\n\n\nIf you don't want to create or use your custom VPC, you can use the \ndefault-aws-network\n for all your Cloudbreak \nclusters. It will create a new VPC with a \n10.0.0.0/16\n subnet every time a cluster is created.\n\n\nCustom AWS Network\n\n\nIf you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom VPC you'll have to \ncreate a new network\n template, to create a new \nsubnet within the VPC, provide the ID of the subnet which is in the existing VPC.\n\n\nA network also can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to \nstart a new stack).\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n The subnet CIDR cannot overlap each other in a VPC. So you have to create different network templates \nfor every each clusters.\nFor example you can create 3 different clusters with 3 different network templates for multiple subnets 10.0.0.0/24,\n 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24 with the same VPC and IGW identifiers.\n\n\n\n\nnetwork create --AWS --name my-aws-network --subnet 10.0.0.0/16\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--vpcID\n your existing vpc on amazon\n\n\n--internetGatewayID\n your amazon internet gateway of the given VPC\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the network was created successfully\n\n\nnetwork list\n\n\n\n\nDefining cluster services\n\n\nBlueprints\n\n\nBlueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own ones.\nBlueprints can be added from file or URL (an \nexample blueprint\n).\n\n\nThe host groups in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster. Besides this the services and\n components will also be installed on the corresponding nodes. Blueprints can be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Not necessary to define all the configuration in the blueprint. If a configuration is missing, Ambari will fill that with a default value.\n\n\n\n\nblueprint add --name my-blueprint --description \nsample description\n --file \nthe path of the blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--url\n the url of the blueprint\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the blueprint was created successfully\n\n\nblueprint list\n\n\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight \nmodifications.\n\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the \nmodifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations are hardcoded for example domain names, memory configurations..etc. that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster.\n\n\nMetadata show\n\n\nYou can check the stack metadata with\n\n\nstack metadata --name myawsstack --instancegroup master\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--id\n In this case you can select a stack with id.\n\n\n--outputType\n In this case you can modify the outputformat of the command (RAW or JSON). \n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster. The following sub-sections show \nyou a \nbasic flow for cluster creation with Cloudbreak Shell\n.\n\n\nSelect credential\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created AWS credential:\n\n\ncredential select --name my-aws-credential\n\n\n\n\nSelect blueprint\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created blueprint which fits your needs:\n\n\nblueprint select --name multi-node-hdfs-yarn\n\n\n\n\nConfigure instance groups\n\n\nYou must configure instance groups before provisioning. An instance group define a group of nodes with a specified \ntemplate. Usually we create instance groups for host groups in the blueprint. For Ambari server only 1 host group can be specified.\nIf you want to install the Ambari server to a separate node, you need to extend your blueprint with a new host group\nwhich contains only 1 service: HDFS_CLIENT and select this host group for the Ambari server. Note: this host group cannot be scaled so \nit is not advised to select a 'slave' host group for this purpose.\n\n\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup master --nodecount 1 --templateName minviable-aws --ambariServer true\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup slave_1 --nodecount 1 --templateName minviable-aws --ambariServer false\n\n\n\n\nOther available option:\n\n\n--templateId\n Id of the template\n\n\nSelect network\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created network which fits your needs or a default one:\n\n\nnetwork select --name default-aws-network\n\n\n\n\nSelect security group\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created security which fits your needs or a default one:\n\n\nsecuritygroup select --name all-services-port\n\n\n\n\nCreate stack / Create cloud infrastructure\n\n\nStack means the running cloud infrastructure that is created based on the instance groups configured earlier \n(\ncredential\n, \ninstancegroups\n, \nnetwork\n, \nsecuritygroup\n). Same as in case of the API or UI the new cluster will \nuse your templates and by using CloudFormation will launch your cloud stack. Use the following command to create a \nstack to be used with your Hadoop cluster:\n\n\nstack create --name myawsstack --region us-east-1\n\n\n\n\nThe infrastructure is created asynchronously, the state of the stack can be checked with the stack \nshow command\n. If \nit reports AVAILABLE, it means that the virtual machines and the corresponding infrastructure is running at the cloud provider.\n\n\nOther available option is:\n\n\n--wait\n - in this case the create command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n--instanceProfileStrategy\n - strategy for seamless S3 connection. (CREATE, USE_EXISTING)\n\n--s3Role\n - If you selected 'USE_EXISTING' strategy then you should define the S3 role which will be assigned to instances.\n\n\nCreate a Hadoop cluster / Cloud provisioning\n\n\nYou are almost done! One more command and your Hadoop cluster is starting!\n Cloud provisioning is done once the \ncluster is up and running. The new cluster will use your selected blueprint and install your custom Hadoop cluster \nwith the selected components and services.\n\n\ncluster create --description \nmy first cluster\n\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--wait\n - in this case the create command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n\nYou are done!\n You have several opportunities to check the progress during the infrastructure creation then \nprovisioning:\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak uses \nCloudFormation\n to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak on\n the AWS Console CloudFormation page.\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf stack then cluster creation have successfully done, you can check the Ambari Web UI. However you need to know the \nAmbari IP (for example: \nhttp://52.8.110.95:8080\n): \n\n\nYou can get the IP from the CLI as a result (\nambariServerIp 52.8.110.95\n) of the following command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         cluster show\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nBesides these you can check the entire progress and the Ambari IP as well on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself. Open the \nnew cluster's \ndetails\n and its \nEvent History\n here.\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nStop cluster\n\n\nYou have the ability to \nstop your existing stack then its cluster\n if you want to suspend the work on it.\n\n\nSelect a stack for example with its name:\n\n\nstack select --name my-stack\n\n\n\n\nOther available option to define a stack is its \n--id\n.\n\n\nEvery time you should stop the \ncluster\n first then the \nstack\n. So apply following commands to stop the previously \nselected stack:\n\n\ncluster stop\nstack stop\n\n\n\n\nRestart cluster\n\n\nSelect your stack that you would like to restart\n after this you can apply:\n\n\nstack start\n\n\n\n\nAfter the stack has successfully restarted, you can \nrestart the related cluster as well\n:\n\n\ncluster start\n\n\n\n\nUpscale cluster\n\n\nIf you need more instances to your infrastructure, you can \nupscale your selected stack\n:\n\n\nstack node --ADD --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--withClusterUpScale\n - this indicates also a cluster upscale after the stack upscale. You\n can upscale the related cluster separately if you want to do this:\n\n\ncluster node --ADD --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6\n\n\n\n\nDownscale cluster\n\n\nYou also can reduce the number of instances in your infrastructure. \nAfter you selected your stack\n:\n\n\ncluster node --REMOVE  --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--withStackDownScale\n - this indicates also a stack downscale after the cluster downscale.\n You can downscale the related stack separately if you want to do this:\n\n\nstack node --REMOVE  --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2\n\n\n\n\nCluster termination\n\n\nYou can terminate running or stopped clusters with\n\n\nstack terminate --name myawsstack\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--wait\n - in this case the terminate command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster. If that fails for some reason, try to delete the \nCloudFormation stack first. Instances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an instance manually!\n\n\n\n\nSometimes Cloudbreak cannot synchronize it's state with the cluster state at the cloud provider and the cluster can't\n be terminated.

IMPORTANT  Cloudbreak deployment uses two different AWS accounts for two different purposes:    The account belonging to the  Cloudbreak webapp  itself, acts as a  third party , that creates resources on the \naccount of the  end user .

These accounts are usually  the same  when the end user is the same who deployed the Cloudbreak server, but it allows\n Cloudbreak to act as a SaaS project as well if needed.  Credentials use  IAM Roles  to give access to the \nthird party to act on behalf of the end user without giving full access to your resources.\nThis IAM Role will be  assumed  later by an IAM user.  AWS IAM Policy that grants permission to assume a role  You cannot assume a role with root account , so you need to  create an IAM user  with an attached  Inline  \npolicy  and  then set the \nAccess key and Secret Access key  in the  Profile  file (check  this description  out).

Resources are only created\n on AWS after the  create cluster  button has pushed.  These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \n reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.  Templates  Templates describe the  instances of your cluster  - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.  The instance templates can be configured on the  manage templates  panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.  There are some optional configurations here as well:   Spot price (USD)  If specified Cloudbreak will request spot price instances (which might take a while or never be \nfulfilled by Amazon).  This option is  not supported  by the default RedHat images .  EBS encryption  is supported for all volume types. If this option is checked then all the attached disks  will be encrypted  by Amazon using the AWS KMS master keys.  If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create clusters, but cannot delete it.   Networks  Your clusters can be created in their own  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)  or in one of your already existing VPCs.\nIf you choose an existing VPC it is possible to create a new subnet within the VPC or use an already existing one.\nThe subnet's IP range must be defined in the  Subnet (CIDR)  field using the general CIDR notation.  Default AWS Network  If you don't want to create or use your custom VPC, you can use the  default-aws-network  for all your\nCloudbreak clusters. It will create a new VPC with a  10.0.0.0/16  subnet every time a cluster is created.  Custom AWS Network  If you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom VPC you'll have to  create a new network  template on the  manage\nnetworks  panel.  You have the following options:   Create a new VPC and a new subnet : Every time a cluster is created with this kind of network setup a new VPC and a new subnet with the specified IP range will be created for the instances on AWS.  Create a new subnet in an existing VPC :  Use this kind of network setup if you already have a VPC on AWS where you'd like to put the Cloudbreak created cluster but you'd like to have a separate subnet for it. This setup is only supported for basic VPCs, where an Internet Gateway is configured and instances can have public IP addresses to access the Internet. If you have a specific VPC setup (VGW, NAT, private subnets, etc..) then only the third option can be used.  Use an existing subnet in an existing VPC :  Use this kind of network setup if you have an existing VPC with one or more subnets on AWS and you'd like to start the instances of a cluster in one of those subnets. Use this setup if you have a specific VPC setup: you should first create the subnet(s) where you'd like to install your clusters directly through AWS and provide their IDs here. In this case there are only 2 requirements for the subnets:  instances in the subnet should be able to reach the Internet to download yum packages (it can be done through a Virtual Gateway, a NAT instance, an Internet Gateway or any other setup)  the VM where Cloudbreak is deployed must be able to reach the instances in the cluster on port 443. (It\u2019s in the same subnet, or through a router from another subnet)  NOTE : instances in the subnet doesn't need to have public IP addresses in this case   You can configure the  Subnet Identifier  and the  Internet Gateway Identifier  (IGW) of your VPC.   IMPORTANT  The subnet CIDR cannot overlap each other in a VPC. So you have to create different network\ntemplates for every each clusters.   To create a new subnet within the VPC, provide the ID of the subnet which is in the existing VPC and your cluster\nwill be launched into that subnet.  For example  you can create 3 different clusters with 3 different network\ntemplates for multiple subnets  10.0.0.0/24 ,  10.0.1.0/24 ,  10.0.2.0/24  with the same VPC and IGW identifiers.   IMPORTANT  Please make sure the define subnet here doesn't overlap with any of your already deployed subnet in\nthe VPC, because of the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.  In case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances.   If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template\nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.   NOTE  The VPCs, IGWs and subnet are created on AWS only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected\nnetwork template.    Full size  here .  Security groups  Security group templates are very similar to the  security groups on the AWS Console . They describe the allowed inbound traffic to the instances in the cluster. \nCurrently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster and all the instances have a \npublic IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security group.\nThis may change in a later release.  Default Security Group  You can also use the two pre-defined security groups in Cloudbreak.  only-ssh-and-ssl:  all ports are locked down except for SSH and the selected Ambari Server HTTPS (you can't access Hadoop services outside of the VPC):   SSH (22)  HTTPS (443)   all-services-port:  all Hadoop services, SSH and HTTPS are accessible by default:   SSH (22)  HTTPS (443)  Ambari (8080)  Consul (8500)  NN (50070)  RM Web (8088)  Scheduler (8030RM)  IPC (8050RM)  Job history server (19888)  HBase master (60000)  HBase master web (60010)  HBase RS (16020)  HBase RS info (60030)  Falcon (15000)  Storm (8744)  Hive metastore (9083)  Hive server (10000)  Hive server HTTP (10001)  Accumulo master (9999)  Accumulo Tserver (9997)  Atlas (21000)  KNOX (8443)  Oozie (11000)  Spark HS (18080)  NM Web (8042)  Zeppelin WebSocket (9996)  Zeppelin UI (9995)  Kibana (3080)  Elasticsearch (9200)   Custom Security Group  You can define your own security group by adding all the ports, protocols and CIDR range you'd like to use.

Resources are only created\n on AWS after the  cluster create  has applied.  These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \n reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.  Templates  Templates describe the  instances of your cluster  - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.  A template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a \nnew stack). Templates can be configured with the following command for example:  template create --AWS --name my-aws-template --description  sample description  --instanceType m4.large --volumeSize \n100 --volumeCount 2  Other available option here is  --publicInAccount . If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able\n to use this template to create clusters, but cannot delete it.  You can check whether the template was created successfully  template list  Networks  Your clusters can be created in their own  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)  or in one of your already existing VPCs. If \nyou choose an existing VPC it is possible to create a new subnet within the VPC or use an already existing one. The \nsubnet's IP range must be defined in the  Subnet (CIDR)  field using the general CIDR notation.  Default AWS Network  If you don't want to create or use your custom VPC, you can use the  default-aws-network  for all your Cloudbreak \nclusters. It will create a new VPC with a  10.0.0.0/16  subnet every time a cluster is created.  Custom AWS Network  If you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom VPC you'll have to  create a new network  template, to create a new \nsubnet within the VPC, provide the ID of the subnet which is in the existing VPC.  A network also can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to \nstart a new stack).   IMPORTANT  The subnet CIDR cannot overlap each other in a VPC. So you have to create different network templates \nfor every each clusters.\nFor example you can create 3 different clusters with 3 different network templates for multiple subnets 10.0.0.0/24,\n 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24 with the same VPC and IGW identifiers.   network create --AWS --name my-aws-network --subnet 10.0.0.0/16  Other available options:  --vpcID  your existing vpc on amazon  --internetGatewayID  your amazon internet gateway of the given VPC  --publicInAccount  If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.

However you need to know the \nAmbari IP (for example:  http://52.8.110.95:8080 ):   You can get the IP from the CLI as a result ( ambariServerIp 52.8.110.95 ) of the following command:              cluster show  For example:  Full size  here .

Read more \nhere\n\n\n\n\ncbd azure configure-arm --app_name myapp --app_password password123 --subscription_id 1234-abcd-efgh-1234\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--app_name\n your new application name, \napp\n by default\n\n\n--app_password\n your application password, \npassword\n by default\n\n\n--subscription_id\n your Azure subscription ID\n\n\n--username\n your Azure username\n\n\n--password\n your Azure password\n\n\nThe command applies the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nIt creates an Active Directory application with the configured name, password\n\n\nIt grants permissions to call the Azure Resource Manager API\n\n\n\n\nPlease use the output of the command when you creating your Azure credential in Cloudbreak.\n The major part of \nthe output should be like this example:\n\n\nSubscription ID: sdf324-26b3-sdf234-ad10-234dfsdfsd\nApp ID: 234sdf-c469-sdf234-9062-dsf324\nPassword: password123\nApp Owner Tenant ID: sdwerwe1-d98e-dsf12-dsf123-df123232\n\n\n\n\nFile system configuration\n\n\nWhen starting a cluster with Cloudbreak on Azure, the default file system is \u201cWindows Azure Blob Storage\u201d. Hadoop has \nbuilt-in support for the \nWASB file system\n so it can be\nused easily as HDFS.\n\n\nDisks and blob storage\n\n\nIn Azure every data disk attached to a virtual machine \nis stored\n as a virtual hard disk (VHD) in a page blob inside an Azure storage account. Because these are not local disks and the operations must be done on the VHD files it causes degraded performance when used as HDFS.\nWhen WASB is used as a Hadoop file system the files are full-value blobs in a storage account. It means better performance compared to the data disks and the WASB file system can be configured very easily but Azure storage accounts have their own \nlimitations\n as well. There is a space limitation for TB per storage account (500 TB) as well but the real bottleneck is the total request rate that is only 20000 IOPS where Azure will start to throw errors when trying to do an I/O operation.\nTo bypass those limits Microsoft created a small service called \nDASH\n. DASH itself is a service that imitates the API of the Azure Blob Storage API and it can be deployed as a Microsoft Azure Cloud Service. Because its API is the same as the standard blob storage API it can be used \nalmost\n in the same way as the default WASB file system from a Hadoop deployment.\nDASH works by sharding the storage access across multiple storage accounts. It can be configured to distribute storage account load to at most 15 \nscaleout\n storage accounts. It needs one more \nnamespace\n storage account where it keeps track of where the data is stored.\nWhen configuring a WASB file system with Hadoop, the only required config entries are the ones where the access details are described. To access a storage account Azure generates an access key that is displayed on the Azure portal or can be queried through the API while the account name is the name of the storage account itself. A DASH service has a similar account name and key, those can be configured in the configuration file while deploying the cloud service.\n\n\n\n\nDeploying a DASH service with Cloudbreak Deployer\n\n\nWe automated the deployment of DASH service in Cloudbreak Deployer. After \ncbd\n is installed, simply run the \nfollowing command to deploy a DASH cloud service with 5 scale out storage accounts:\n\n\ncbd azure deploy-dash --accounts 5 --prefix dash --location \nWest Europe\n --instances 3\n\n\n\n\nThe command applies the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nIt creates the namespace account and the scale out storage accounts\n\n\nIt builds the \n.cscfg\n configuration file based on the created storage account names and keys\n\n\nIt generates an Account Name and an Account Key for the DASH service\n\n\nFinally it deploys the cloud service package file to a new cloud service\n\n\n\n\nThe WASB file system configured with DASH can be used as a data lake - when multiple clusters are deployed with the \nsame DASH file system configuration the same data can be accessed from all the clusters, but every cluster can have a \ndifferent service configured as well. In that case deploy as many DASH services with \ncbd\n as clusters with \nCloudbreak and configure them accordingly.\n\n\nContainers within the storage account\n\n\nCloudbreak creates a new container in the configured storage account for each cluster with the following name \npattern \ncloudbreak-UNIQUE_ID\n. Re-using existing containers in the same account is not supported as dirty data can \nlead to failing cluster installations. In order to take advantage of the WASB file system your data does not have to \nbe in the same storage account nor in the same container. You can add as many accounts as you wish through Ambari, by\n setting the properties described \nhere\n. Once you \n added the appropriate properties you can use those storage accounts with the pre-existing data, like:\n\n\nhadoop fs -ls wasb://data@youraccount.blob.core.windows.net/terasort-input/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Make sure that your cloud account can launch instances using the new Azure ARM (a.k.a. V2) API and \nyou have sufficient qouta (CPU, network, etc) for the requested cluster size.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new SSH key\n\n\nAll the instances created by Cloudbreak are configured to allow key-based SSH,\nso you'll need to provide an SSH public key that can be used later to SSH onto the instances in the clusters you'll create with Cloudbreak.\nYou can use one of your existing keys or you can generate a new one.\n\n\nTo generate a new SSH keypair:\n\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \nyour_email@example.com\n\n# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label\n# Generating public/private rsa key pair.\n\n\n\n\n# Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]\nYou'll be asked to enter a passphrase, but you can leave it empty.\n\n# Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]\n# Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\n\n\n\n\nAfter you enter a passphrase the keypair is generated. The output should look something like below.\n\n\n# Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.\n# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\n# The key fingerprint is:\n# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:sd:17:sd:7d:sd:68:9d:sd:a2:sd your_email@example.com\n\n\n\n\nLater you'll need to pass the \n.pub\n file's contents to Cloudbreak and use the private part to SSH to the instances\n\n\nProvisioning via Browser\n\n\nYou can log into the Cloudbreak application at \nhttp://\nPublic_IP\n:3000/\n.\n\n\nThe main goal of the Cloudbreak UI is to easily create clusters on your own cloud provider account.\nThis description details the AZURE setup - if you'd like to use a different cloud provider check out its manual.\n\n\nThis document explains the four steps that need to be followed to create Cloudbreak clusters from the UI:\n\n\n\n\nconnect your AZURE account with Cloudbreak\n\n\ncreate some template resources on the UI that describe the infrastructure of your clusters\n\n\ncreate a blueprint that describes the HDP services in your clusters\n\n\nlaunch the cluster itself based on these template resource\n\n\n\n\nSetting up Azure credentials\n\n\nCloudbreak works by connecting your AZURE account through so called \nCredentials\n, and then uses these credentials to \ncreate resources on your behalf. The credentials can be configured on the \nmanage credentials\n panel on the \nCloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nPlease read the \nProvisioning prerequisites\n where you \ncan find the steps how can get the mandatory \nSubscription ID\n, \nApp ID\n, \nPassword\n and \nApp Owner Tenant ID\n for \nyour Cloudbreak credential.\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new AZURE credential follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nFill out the new credential \nName\n\n\nOnly alphanumeric and lowercase characters (min 5, max 100 characters) can be applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy your AZURE Subscription ID to the \nSubscription Id\n field\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nCopy your AZURE Active Directory Application:\n\n\nID to the \nApp Id\n field\n\n\npassword to the \nPassword\n field\n\n\nApp Owner Tenant Id\n field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nCopy your SSH public key to the \nSSH public key\n field\n\n\nThe SSH public key must be in OpenSSH format and it's private keypair can be used later to \nSSH onto every \ninstance\n of every cluster you'll create with this credential.\n\n\nThe \nSSH username\n for the AZURE instances is \ncloudbreak\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny other parameter is optional here.\n\n\nPublic in account\n means that all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this credential to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nCloudbreak is supporting simple rsa public key instead of X509 certificate file after 1.0.4 version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nInfrastructure templates\n\n\nAfter your AZURE account is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating resource templates that describe your clusters' \ninfrastructure:\n\n\n\n\ntemplates\n\n\nnetworks\n\n\nsecurity groups\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create one of the above resource, \nCloudbreak does not make any requests to AZURE. Resources are only created\n on AZURE after the \ncreate cluster\n button has pushed.\n These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \n reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTemplates describe the \ninstances of your cluster\n - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.\n\n\nThe instance templates can be configured on the \nmanage templates\n panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\nThe \nVolume Type\n describes the \nStorage Account type\n which will be used for the attached disks. The only constraint is that the \nPremium storage\n can only be used\nfor \nDS\n instance types. For more details about the premium storage read \nthis\n.\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\nis checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it\n\n\nNetworks\n\n\nYour clusters can be created in their own \nnetworks\n or in one of your already existing one. The subnet's IP range must be defined in \nthe \nSubnet (CIDR)\n field using the general CIDR notation.\n\n\nDefault AZURE Network\n\n\nIf you don't want to create or use your custom network, you can use the \ndefault-azure-network\n for all your \nCloudbreak clusters. It will create a new network with a \n10.0.0.0/16\n subnet every time a cluster is created.\n\n\nCustom AZURE Network\n\n\nIf you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom network you'll have to \ncreate a new network\n template on the \nmanage \nnetworks\n panel.\n\n\nYou have the following options:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new virtual network and a new subnet\n:  Every time a cluster is created with this kind of network setup a new virtual network and a new subnet with the specified IP range will be created for the instances on Azure.\n\n\nUse an existing subnet in an existing virtual network\n: Use this kind of network setup if you have an existing virtual network with one or more subnets on Azure and you'd like to start the instances of a cluster in one of those subnets. In this case you can define the \nSubnet Identifier\n and the \nVirtual Network Identifier\n and the \nResource Group Identifier\n of your network. The \nResource Group Identifier\n identifies the resource group which contains your existing virtual network. The \nVirtual Network Identifier\n and the \nSubnet Identifier\n will tell Cloudbreak which network and subnet to use to launch the new instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n In case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances. The \nprovided subnet CIDR will be ignored, but the existing subnet's CIDR range will be used. The security group behavior will be changed in this case as well\ndescribed in the security group section below.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template \nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The new networks are created on AZURE only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nnetwork template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nSecurity groups\n\n\nSecurity group templates are very similar to the \nsecurity groups on Azure\n.\n\nThey describe the allowed inbound traffic to the instances in the cluster.\n\nCurrently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster and all the instances have a \npublic IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security group.\nThis may change in a later release.\n\n\nDefault Security Group\n\n\nYou can also use the two pre-defined security groups in Cloudbreak.\n\n\nonly-ssh-and-ssl:\n all ports are locked down except for SSH and the selected Ambari Server HTTPS (you can't access Hadoop services \noutside of the virtual network):\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nHTTPS (443)\n\n\n\n\nall-services-port:\n all Hadoop services, SSH and HTTPS are accessible by default:\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nHTTPS (443)\n\n\nAmbari (8080)\n\n\nConsul (8500)\n\n\nNN (50070)\n\n\nRM Web (8088)\n\n\nScheduler (8030RM)\n\n\nIPC (8050RM)\n\n\nJob history server (19888)\n\n\nHBase master (60000)\n\n\nHBase master web (60010)\n\n\nHBase RS (16020)\n\n\nHBase RS info (60030)\n\n\nFalcon (15000)\n\n\nStorm (8744)\n\n\nHive metastore (9083)\n\n\nHive server (10000)\n\n\nHive server HTTP (10001)\n\n\nAccumulo master (9999)\n\n\nAccumulo Tserver (9997)\n\n\nAtlas (21000)\n\n\nKNOX (8443)\n\n\nOozie (11000)\n\n\nSpark HS (18080)\n\n\nNM Web (8042)\n\n\nZeppelin WebSocket (9996)\n\n\nZeppelin UI (9995)\n\n\nKibana (3080)\n\n\nElasticsearch (9200)\n\n\n\n\nCustom Security Group\n\n\nYou can define your own security group by adding all the ports, protocols and CIDR range you'd like to use. The rules\n defined here doesn't need to contain the internal rules, those are automatically added by Cloudbreak to the security\n  group on Azure.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n 443 and 22 ports needs to be there in every security group otherwise Cloudbreak won't be able to communicate with the \nprovisioned cluster\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this security group \ntemplate to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The security groups are created on Azure only after the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nsecurity group template.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n If you use and existing virtual network and subnet the selected security group will only be applied to the selected Ambari Server node due to the lack of\ncapability to attach multiple security groups to an existing subnet. If you'd like to open ports for Hadoop you must do it on your existing security group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n/sub\n\n\nDefining cluster services\n\n\nBlueprints\n\n\nBlueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own ones.\nBlueprints can be added from file, URL (an \nexample blueprint\n) or the \nwhole JSON can be written in the \nJSON text\n box.\n\n\nThe host groups in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster. Besides this the services and\n components will also be installed on the corresponding nodes. Blueprints can be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Not necessary to define all the configuration in the blueprint. If a configuration is missing, Ambari will \nfill that with a default value.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to \ncreate clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight \nmodifications.\n\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the \nmodifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations are hardcoded for example domain names, memory configurations...etc. that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster\n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster.\n\n\nHere is a \nbasic flow for cluster creation on Cloudbreak Web UI\n:\n\n\n\n\nStart by selecting a previously created Azure credential in the header.\n\n\nOpen \ncreate cluster\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Cluster\n tab\n\n\n\n\nFill out the new cluster \nname\n\n\nCluster name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character then you can apply lowercase alphanumeric and\n   hyphens only (min 5, max 40 characters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a \nRegion\n where you like your cluster be provisioned\n\n\nClick on the \nSetup Network and Security\n button\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to see the created cluster on\n the UI, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Network and Security\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the networks\n\n\nSelect one of the security groups\n\n\nClick on the \nChoose Blueprint\n button\n\n\nIf \nEnable security\n is checked as well, Cloudbreak will install Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the cluster will\nbe Kerberized. See more about it in the \nKerberos\n section of this documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Blueprint\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the blueprint\n\n\nAfter you've selected a \nBlueprint\n, you should be able to configure:\n\n\nthe templates\n\n\nthe number of nodes for all of the host groups in the blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to select where you want to install the Ambari server to. Only 1 host group can be selected.\n   If you want to install the Ambari server to a separate node, you need to extend your blueprint with a new host group\n   which contains only 1 service: HDFS_CLIENT and select this host group for the Ambari server. Note: this host group cannot be scaled so\n   it is not advised to select a 'slave' host group for this purpose.\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd File System\n button\n\n\n\n\nAdd File System\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the file system that fits your needs\n\n\nAfter you've selected \nWASB\n or \nDASH\n, you should configure:\n\n\nStorage Account Name\n\n\nStorage Account Access Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nReview and Launch\n button\n\n\nFile system\n is a mandatory configuration for Azure. You can read more about WASB and DASH in the \nFile System Configuration section\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview and Launch\n tab\n\n\n\n\nAfter the \ncreate and start cluster\n button has clicked Cloudbreak will start to create the cluster's resources on\n your Azure account.\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak uses \nAzure Resource Manager\n to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak\n on\nthe \nAzure Portal Resource groups\n page.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nBesides these you can check the progress on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself if you open the new cluster's \nEvent History\n.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nAdvanced options\n\n\nThere are some advanced features when deploying a new cluster, these are the following:\n\n\nAmbari Username\n This user will be used as admin user in Ambari. You can log in using this username on the Ambari UI.\n\n\nAmbari Password\n The password associated with the Ambari username. This password will be also the default password for all required passwords which are not specified in the blueprint. E.g: hive DB password.\n\n\nMinimum cluster size\n The provisioning strategy in case of the cloud provider cannot allocate all the requested nodes.\n\n\nValidate blueprint\n This is selected by default. Cloudbreak validates the Ambari blueprint in this case.\n\n\nShipyard enabled cluster\n This is selected by default. Cloudbreak will start a \nShipyard\n container which helps you to manage your containers.\n\n\nPersistent Storage Name\n This is \ncbstore\n by default. Cloudbreak will copy the image into a storage which is not deleting under the termination. When you starting a new cluster then the provisioning will be much faster because of the existing image.\n\n\nAttached Storage Type\n This is \nsingle storage for all vm\n by default. If are you using the default option then your whole cluster will by in one storage which could be a bottleneck in case of \nAzure\n. If you are using the \nseparated storage for every vm\n then we will deploy as much storage account as many node you have and in this case IOPS limit concern just for one node.\n\n\nConfig recommendation strategy\n Strategy for configuration recommendations how will be applied. Recommended\nconfigurations gathered by the response of the stack advisor.\n\n\n\n\nNEVER_APPLY\n               Configuration recommendations are ignored with this option.\n\n\nONLY_STACK_DEFAULTS_APPLY\n Applies only on the default configurations for all included services.\n\n\nALWAYS_APPLY\n              Applies on all configuration properties.\n\n\n\n\nCluster termination\n\n\nYou can terminate running or stopped clusters with the \nterminate\n button in the cluster details.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster. If that fails for some reason, try to delete the \nAzure resource group first. Instances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an \ninstance manually!\n\n\n\n\nSometimes Cloudbreak cannot synchronize it's state with the cluster state at the cloud provider and the cluster can't\n be terminated. In this case the \nForced termination\n option can help to terminate the cluster at the Cloudbreak \n side. \nIf it has happened:\n\n\n\n\nYou should check the related resources at the Azure Portal\n\n\nIf it is needed you need to manually remove resources from there\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nInteractive mode / Cloudbreak Shell\n\n\nThe goal with the Cloudbreak Shell (Cloudbreak CLI) was to provide an interactive command line tool which supports:\n\n\n\n\nall functionality available through the REST API or Cloudbreak Web UI\n\n\nmakes possible complete automation of management task via scripts\n\n\ncontext aware command availability\n\n\ntab completion\n\n\nrequired/optional parameter support\n\n\nhint command to guide you on the usual path\n\n\n\n\nStart Cloudbreak Shell\n\n\nTo start the Cloudbreak CLI use the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nOpen your \ncloudbreak-deployment\n directory if it is needed. For example:\n\n\n\n\n   cd cloudbreak-deployment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the \ncbd\n from here if it is needed\n\n\n\n\n   cbd start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the root of your \ncloudbreak-deployment\n folder apply:\n\n\n\n\n   cbd util cloudbreak-shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the very first time it will take for a while, because of need to download all the necessary docker images.\n\n\n\n\nThis will launch the Cloudbreak shell inside a Docker container then it is ready to use.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT You have to copy all your files into the \ncbd\n working directory, what you would like to use in shell.\n For \nexample if your \ncbd\n working directory is \n~/cloudbreak-deployment\n then copy your \nblueprint JSON, public ssh key \nfile...etc.\n to here. You can refer to these files with their names from the shell.\n\n\n\n\nAutocomplete and hints\n\n\nCloudbreak Shell helps to you with \nhint messages\n from the very beginning, for example:\n\n\ncloudbreak-shell\nhint\nHint: Add a blueprint with the 'blueprint add' command or select an existing one with 'blueprint select'\ncloudbreak-shell\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond this you can use the \nautocompletion (double-TAB)\n as well:\n\n\ncloudbreak-shell\ncredential create --\ncredential create --AWS          credential create --AZURE        credential create --EC2          credential create --GCP          credential create --OPENSTACK\n\n\n\n\nProvisioning via CLI\n\n\nSetting up Azure credential\n\n\nCloudbreak works by connecting your Azure account through so called Credentials, and then uses these credentials to \ncreate resources on your behalf. Credentials can be configured with the following command for example:\n\n\ncredential create --AZURE --name my-azure-credential --description \nsample credential\n --subscriptionId \nyour-azure-subscription-id --tenantId your-azure-application-tenant-id --appId \nyour-azure-application-id --password YourApplicationPassword --sshKeyString \nssh-rsa AAAAB3***etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak is supporting simple rsa public key instead of X509 certificate file after 1.0.4 version\n\n\nNOTE\n that Cloudbreak \ndoes not set your cloud user details\n - we work around the concept of Access Control \nService (ACS). You should have already a valid Azure Subscription and Application. You can find further details \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives to provide \nSSH Key\n:\n\n\n\n\nyou can upload your public key from an url: \n\u2014sshKeyUrl\n \n\n\nor you can add the path of your public key: \n\u2014sshKeyPath\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether the credential was created successfully\n\n\ncredential list\n\n\n\n\nYou can switch between your existing credentials\n\n\ncredential select --name my-azure-credential\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure templates\n\n\nAfter your Azure account is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating resource templates that describe your clusters' \ninfrastructure:\n\n\n\n\nsecurity groups\n\n\nnetworks\n\n\ntemplates\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create one of the above resource, \nCloudbreak does not make any requests to Azure. Resources are only created\n on Azure after the \ncluster create\n has applied.\n These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \n reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTemplates describe the \ninstances of your cluster\n - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.\n\n\nA template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a \nnew stack). Templates can be configured with the following command for example:\n\n\ntemplate create --AZURE --name my-azure-template --description \nsample description\n --instanceType Standard_D4 --volumeSize 100 --volumeCount 2 --volumeType Standard_LRS\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVolume Type\n describes the \nStorage Account type\n which will be used for the attached disks. The only constraint is that the \nPremium storage\n can only be used\nfor \nDS\n instance types. For more details about the premium storage read \nthis\n.\n\n\nOther available option here is \n--publicInAccount\n. If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able\n to use this template to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the template was created successfully\n\n\ntemplate list\n\n\n\n\nNetworks\n\n\nYour clusters can be created in their own \nnetworks\n or in one of your already existing one. If you choose an \nexisting network, it is possible to create a new subnet within the network. The subnet's IP range must be defined in \nthe \nSubnet (CIDR)\n field using the general CIDR notation.\n\n\nDefault AZURE Network\n\n\nIf you don't want to create or use your custom network, you can use the \ndefault-azure-network\n for all your \nCloudbreak clusters. It will create a new network with a \n10.0.0.0/16\n subnet and \n10.0.0.0/8\n address prefix every \ntime a cluster is created.\n\n\nCustom AZURE Network\n\n\nIf you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom network you'll have to apply the following command:\n\n\nnetwork create --AZURE --name my-azure-network --addressPrefix 192.168.123.123 --subnet 10.0.0.0/16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Please make sure the defined subnet and theirs address prefixes here doesn't overlap with any of your \nalready deployed subnet and its already used address prefix in the network, because of the validation only happens \nafter the cluster creation \nstarts.\n\n\nIn case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances. The \nprovided subnet CIDR will be ignored, but a proper CIDR range will be used.\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether the network was created successfully\n\n\nnetwork list\n\n\n\n\n--addressPrefix\n This list will be appended to the current list of address prefixes.\n\n\n\n\nThe address prefixes in this list should not overlap between them.\n\n\nThe address prefixes in this list should not overlap with existing address prefixes in the network.\n\n\n\n\nYou can find more details about the AZURE Address Prefixes \nhere\n.\n\n\nIf \n--publicInAccount\n is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template \nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The new networks are created on AZURE only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nnetwork template.\n\n\n\n\nDefining cluster services\n\n\nBlueprints\n\n\nBlueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own ones.\nBlueprints can be added from file or URL (an \nexample blueprint\n).\n\n\nThe host groups in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster. Besides this the services and\n components will also be installed on the corresponding nodes. Blueprints can be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Not necessary to define all the configuration in the blueprint. If a configuration is missing, Ambari will fill that with a default value.\n\n\n\n\nblueprint add --name my-blueprint --description \nsample description\n --file \nthe path of the blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--url\n the url of the blueprint\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the blueprint was created successfully\n\n\nblueprint list\n\n\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight \nmodifications.\n\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the \nmodifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations are hardcoded for example domain names, memory configurations..etc. that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster.\n\n\nMetadata show\n\n\nYou can check the stack metadata with\n\n\nstack metadata --name myawsstack --instancegroup master\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--id\n In this case you can select a stack with id.\n\n\n--outputType\n In this case you can modify the outputformat of the command (RAW or JSON). \n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster. The following sub-sections show\nyou a \nbasic flow for cluster creation with Cloudbreak Shell\n.\n\n\nSelect credential\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created Azure credential:\n\n\ncredential select --name my-azure-credential\n\n\n\n\nSelect blueprint\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created blueprint which fits your needs:\n\n\nblueprint select --name multi-node-hdfs-yarn\n\n\n\n\nConfigure instance groups\n\n\nYou must configure instance groups before provisioning. An instance group define a group of nodes with a specified\ntemplate. Usually we create instance groups for host groups in the blueprint. For Ambari server only 1 host group can be specified.\nIf you want to install the Ambari server to a separate node, you need to extend your blueprint with a new host group\nwhich contains only 1 service: HDFS_CLIENT and select this host group for the Ambari server. Note: this host group cannot be scaled so\nit is not advised to select a 'slave' host group for this purpose.\n\n\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup master --nodecount 1 --templateName minviable-aws --ambariServer true\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup slave_1 --nodecount 1 --templateName minviable-aws --ambariServer false\n\n\n\n\nOther available option:\n\n\n--templateId\n Id of the template\n\n\nSelect network\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created network which fits your needs or a default one:\n\n\nnetwork select --name default-azure-network\n\n\n\n\nSelect security group\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created security which fits your needs or a default one:\n\n\nsecuritygroup select --name all-services-port\n\n\n\n\nCreate stack / Create cloud infrastructure\n\n\nStack means the running cloud infrastructure that is created based on the instance groups configured earlier\n(\ncredential\n, \ninstancegroups\n, \nnetwork\n, \nsecuritygroup\n). Same as in case of the API or UI the new cluster will\nuse your templates and by using Azure ARM will launch your cloud stack. Use the following command to create a\nstack to be used with your Hadoop cluster:\n\n\nstack create --name myazurestack --region \nNorth Europe\n\n\n\n\n\nThe infrastructure is created asynchronously, the state of the stack can be checked with the stack \nshow command\n. If\nit reports AVAILABLE, it means that the virtual machines and the corresponding infrastructure is running at the cloud provider.\n\n\nOther available option is:\n\n\n--wait\n - in this case the create command will return only after the process has finished.\n\n\n--persistentStorage\n - This is \ncbstore\n by default. Cloudbreak will copy the image into a storage which is not deleting under the termination. When you starting a new cluster then the provisioning will be much faster because of the existing image.\n\n\n--attachedStorageType\n - This is \nSINGLE\n by default. If you are using the default option then your whole cluster will by in one storage which could be a bottleneck in case of \nAzure\n. If you are using the \nPER_VM\n then we will deploy as much storage account as many node you have and in this case IOPS limit concern just for one node.\n\n\nCreate a Hadoop cluster / Cloud provisioning\n\n\nYou are almost done! One more command and your Hadoop cluster is starting!\n Cloud provisioning is done once the\ncluster is up and running. The new cluster will use your selected blueprint and install your custom Hadoop cluster\nwith the selected components and services.\n\n\ncluster create --description \nmy first cluster\n\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--wait\n - in this case the create command will return only after the process has finished.\n\n\nYou are done!\n You have several opportunities to check the progress during the infrastructure creation then\nprovisioning:\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak uses \nARM\n to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak on\n the Azure Portal Resource groups page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf stack then cluster creation have successfully done, you can check the Ambari Web UI. However you need to know the\nAmbari IP (for example: \nhttp://23.101.60.49:8080\n):\n\n\nYou can get the IP from the CLI as a result (\nambariServerIp 23.101.60.49\n) of the following command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         cluster show\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nBesides these you can check the entire progress and the Ambari IP as well on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself. Open the\nnew cluster's \ndetails\n and its \nEvent History\n here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nStop cluster\n\n\nYou have the ability to \nstop your existing stack then its cluster\n if you want to suspend the work on it.\n\n\nSelect a stack for example with its name:\n\n\nstack select --name my-stack\n\n\n\n\nOther available option to define a stack is its \n--id\n.\n\n\nEvery time you should stop the \ncluster\n first then the \nstack\n. So apply following commands to stop the previously \nselected stack:\n\n\ncluster stop\nstack stop\n\n\n\n\nRestart cluster\n\n\nSelect your stack that you would like to restart\n after this you can apply:\n\n\nstack start\n\n\n\n\nAfter the stack has successfully restarted, you can \nrestart the related cluster as well\n:\n\n\ncluster start\n\n\n\n\nUpscale cluster\n\n\nIf you need more instances to your infrastructure, you can \nupscale your selected stack\n:\n\n\nstack node --ADD --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--withClusterUpScale\n - this indicates also a cluster upscale after the stack upscale. You\n can upscale the related cluster separately if you want to do this:\n\n\ncluster node --ADD --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6\n\n\n\n\nDownscale cluster\n\n\nYou also can reduce the number of instances in your infrastructure. \nAfter you selected your stack\n:\n\n\ncluster node --REMOVE  --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--withStackDownScale\n - this indicates also a stack downscale after the cluster downscale.\n You can downscale the related stack separately if you want to do this:\n\n\nstack node --REMOVE  --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2\n\n\n\n\nCluster termination\n\n\nYou can terminate running or stopped clusters with\n\n\nstack terminate --name myawsstack\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--wait\n - in this case the terminate command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster. If that fails for some reason, try to delete the \nCloudFormation stack first. Instances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an instance manually!\n\n\n\n\nSometimes Cloudbreak cannot synchronize it's state with the cluster state at the cloud provider and the cluster can't\n be terminated. In this case the \nForced termination\n option on the Cloudbreak Web UI can help to terminate the cluster\n  at the Cloudbreak side. \nIf it has happened:\n\n\n\n\nYou should check the related resources at the AWS CloudFormation\n\n\nIf it is needed you need to manually remove resources from ther\n\n\n\n\nSilent mode\n\n\nWith Cloudbreak Shell you can execute script files as well. A script file contains shell commands and can \nbe executed with the \nscript\n cloudbreak shell command\n\n\nscript \nyour script file\n\n\n\n\n\nor with the \ncbd util cloudbreak-shell-quiet\n command\n\n\ncbd util cloudbreak-shell-quiet \n example.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n You have to copy all your files into the \ncbd\n working directory, what you would like to use in shell.\n For example if your \ncbd\n working directory is ~/cloudbreak-deployment then copy your script file to here.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following example creates a hadoop cluster with \nhdp-small-default\n blueprint on Standard_D3 instances with \n2X100G attached disks on \ndefault-azure-network\n network using \nall-services-port\n security group. You should copy \nyour ssh public key file into your \ncbd\n working directory with name \nid_rsa.pub\n and paste your Azure credentials in \nthe parts with \n...\n highlight.\n\n\ncredential create --AZURE --description \ncredential description\n --name myazurecredential --subscriptionId \nyour Azure subscription id\n --appId \nyour Azure application id\n --tenantId \nyour tenant id\n --password \nyour Azure application password\n --sshKeyPath id_rsa.pub\ncredential select --name myazurecredential\ntemplate create --AZURE --name azuretemplate --description azure-template --instanceType Standard_D3 --volumeSize 100 \n--volumeCount 2\nblueprint select --name hdp-small-default\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_master_1 --nodecount 1 --templateName azuretemplate --ambariServer true\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_master_2 --nodecount 1 --templateName azuretemplate --ambariServer false\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_master_3 --nodecount 1 --templateName azuretemplate --ambariServer false\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_client_1  --nodecount 1 --templateName azuretemplate --ambariServer false\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --nodecount 3 --templateName azuretemplate --ambariServer false\nnetwork select --name default-azure-network\nsecuritygroup select --name all-services-port\nstack create --AZURE --name my-first-stack --region \nWest US\n --wait true\ncluster create --description \nMy first cluster\n --wait true\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!\n Your cluster should now be up and running on this way as well.

It means better performance compared to the data disks and the WASB file system can be configured very easily but Azure storage accounts have their own  limitations  as well. There is a space limitation for TB per storage account (500 TB) as well but the real bottleneck is the total request rate that is only 20000 IOPS where Azure will start to throw errors when trying to do an I/O operation.\nTo bypass those limits Microsoft created a small service called  DASH . DASH itself is a service that imitates the API of the Azure Blob Storage API and it can be deployed as a Microsoft Azure Cloud Service. Because its API is the same as the standard blob storage API it can be used  almost  in the same way as the default WASB file system from a Hadoop deployment.\nDASH works by sharding the storage access across multiple storage accounts. It can be configured to distribute storage account load to at most 15  scaleout  storage accounts. It needs one more  namespace  storage account where it keeps track of where the data is stored.\nWhen configuring a WASB file system with Hadoop, the only required config entries are the ones where the access details are described. To access a storage account Azure generates an access key that is displayed on the Azure portal or can be queried through the API while the account name is the name of the storage account itself.

Resources are only created\n on AZURE after the  create cluster  button has pushed.  These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \n reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure  Templates  Templates describe the  instances of your cluster  - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.  The instance templates can be configured on the  manage templates  panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.  The  Volume Type  describes the  Storage Account type  which will be used for the attached disks. The only constraint is that the  Premium storage  can only be used\nfor  DS  instance types. For more details about the premium storage read  this .  If  Public in account is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it  Networks  Your clusters can be created in their own  networks  or in one of your already existing one. The subnet's IP range must be defined in \nthe  Subnet (CIDR)  field using the general CIDR notation.  Default AZURE Network  If you don't want to create or use your custom network, you can use the  default-azure-network  for all your \nCloudbreak clusters. It will create a new network with a  10.0.0.0/16  subnet every time a cluster is created.  Custom AZURE Network  If you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom network you'll have to  create a new network  template on the  manage \nnetworks  panel.  You have the following options:   Create a new virtual network and a new subnet :  Every time a cluster is created with this kind of network setup a new virtual network and a new subnet with the specified IP range will be created for the instances on Azure.  Use an existing subnet in an existing virtual network : Use this kind of network setup if you have an existing virtual network with one or more subnets on Azure and you'd like to start the instances of a cluster in one of those subnets. In this case you can define the  Subnet Identifier  and the  Virtual Network Identifier  and the  Resource Group Identifier  of your network. The  Resource Group Identifier  identifies the resource group which contains your existing virtual network. The  Virtual Network Identifier  and the  Subnet Identifier  will tell Cloudbreak which network and subnet to use to launch the new instances.    IMPORTANT  In case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances. The \nprovided subnet CIDR will be ignored, but the existing subnet's CIDR range will be used. The security group behavior will be changed in this case as well\ndescribed in the security group section below.   If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template \nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.   NOTE  The new networks are created on AZURE only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nnetwork template.    Full size  here .  Security groups  Security group templates are very similar to the  security groups on Azure . They describe the allowed inbound traffic to the instances in the cluster. \nCurrently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster and all the instances have a \npublic IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security group.\nThis may change in a later release.

NOTE  The security groups are created on Azure only after the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nsecurity group template.  IMPORTANT  If you use and existing virtual network and subnet the selected security group will only be applied to the selected Ambari Server node due to the lack of\ncapability to attach multiple security groups to an existing subnet.

However you need to know the\nAmbari IP (for example:  http://23.101.60.49:8080 ):  You can get the IP from the CLI as a result ( ambariServerIp 23.101.60.49 ) of the following command:              cluster show   Full size  here .   Besides these you can check the entire progress and the Ambari IP as well on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself. Open the\nnew cluster's  details  and its  Event History  here.    Full size  here .  Stop cluster  You have the ability to  stop your existing stack then its cluster  if you want to suspend the work on it.  Select a stack for example with its name:  stack select --name my-stack  Other available option to define a stack is its  --id .  Every time you should stop the  cluster  first then the  stack . So apply following commands to stop the previously \nselected stack:  cluster stop\nstack stop  Restart cluster  Select your stack that you would like to restart  after this you can apply:  stack start  After the stack has successfully restarted, you can  restart the related cluster as well :  cluster start  Upscale cluster  If you need more instances to your infrastructure, you can  upscale your selected stack :  stack node --ADD --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6  Other available option is  --withClusterUpScale  - this indicates also a cluster upscale after the stack upscale. You\n can upscale the related cluster separately if you want to do this:  cluster node --ADD --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6  Downscale cluster  You also can reduce the number of instances in your infrastructure.  After you selected your stack :  cluster node --REMOVE  --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2  Other available option is  --withStackDownScale  - this indicates also a stack downscale after the cluster downscale.\n You can downscale the related stack separately if you want to do this:  stack node --REMOVE  --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2",

The credentials can be configured on the \nmanage credentials\n panel on the \nCloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\nTo create a new GCP credential follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nFill out the new credential \nName\n\n\nOnly alphanumeric and lowercase characters (min 5, max 100 characters) can be applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy your GCP project ID to the \nProject Id\n field\n\n\nCopy your GCP Service Account email address to the \nService Account Email Address\n field\n\n\nUpload your GCP Service Account private key (generated \np12 Key\n) to the \nService Account Private (p12) Key\n field\n\n\nCopy your SSH public key to the \nSSH public key\n field\n\n\nThe SSH public key must be in OpenSSH format and it's private keypair can be used later to \nSSH onto every instance\n of every cluster you'll create with this credential.\n\n\nThe \nSSH username\n for the GCP instances is \ncloudbreak\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny other parameter is optional here.\n\n\nPublic in account\n means that all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this credential to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nInfrastructure templates\n\n\nAfter your GCP account is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating resource templates that describe your clusters' \ninfrastructure:\n\n\n\n\ntemplates\n\n\nnetworks\n\n\nsecurity groups\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create one of the above resource, \nCloudbreak does not make any requests to GCP. Resources are only created \non GCP after the \ncreate cluster\n button has pushed.\n These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \nreused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTemplates describe the \ninstances of your cluster\n - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.\n\n\nThe instance templates can be configured on the \nmanage templates\n panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create clusters, but cannot delete it\n\n\nNetworks\n\n\nYour clusters can be created in their own \nnetworks\n or in one of your already existing one. If you choose an \nexisting network, it is possible to create a new subnet within the network. The subnet's IP range must be defined in \nthe \nSubnet (CIDR)\n field using the general CIDR notation. You can read more about \nGCP Networks\n and \nSubnet \nnetworks\n.\n\n\nDefault GCP Network\n\n\nIf you don't want to create or use your custom network, you can use the \ndefault-gcp-network\n for all your \nCloudbreak clusters. It will create a new network with a \n10.0.0.0/16\n subnet every time a cluster is created.\n\n\nCustom GCP Network\n\n\nIf you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom network you'll have to \ncreate a new network\n template on the \nmanage \nnetworks\n panel.\n\n\nYou have the following options:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new virtual network and a new subnet\n: Every time a cluster is created with this kind of network setup a new virtual network and a new subnet with the specified IP range will be created for the instances on Google Cloud.\n\n\nCreate a new subnet in an existing virtual network\n: Use this kind of network setup if you already have a virtual network on Google Cloud where you'd like to put the Cloudbreak created cluster but you'd like to have a separate subnet for it.\n\n\nUse an existing subnet in an existing virtual network\n: Use this kind of network setup if you have an existing virtual network with one or more subnets on Google Cloud and you'd like to start the instances of a cluster in one of those subnets.\n\n\nUse a legacy network without subnets\n: Use this kind of network setup if you have a legacy virtual network on Google Cloud that doesn't have subnet support and you'd like to start instances in that virtual network directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Please make sure the defined subnet here doesn't overlap with any of your already deployed subnet in the\n network, because of the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.\n\n\nIn case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances. The \nprovided subnet CIDR will be ignored, but a proper CIDR range will be used.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template \nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The new networks are created on GCP only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nnetwork template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nSecurity groups\n\n\nSecurity group templates are very similar to the \nFirewalls on GCP\n. \nThey describe the allowed inbound traffic \nto the instances in the cluster.\n Currently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster \nand all the instances have a public IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security \ngroup. This may change in a later release.\n\n\nDefault Security Group\n\n\nYou can also use the two pre-defined security groups in Cloudbreak.\n\n\nonly-ssh-and-ssl:\n all ports are locked down except for SSH and the selected Ambari Server HTTPS (you can't access Hadoop services \noutside of the virtual network):\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nHTTPS (443)\n\n\n\n\nall-services-port:\n all Hadoop services, SSH and HTTPS are accessible by default:\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nHTTPS (443)\n\n\nAmbari (8080)\n\n\nConsul (8500)\n\n\nNN (50070)\n\n\nRM Web (8088)\n\n\nScheduler (8030RM)\n\n\nIPC (8050RM)\n\n\nJob history server (19888)\n\n\nHBase master (60000)\n\n\nHBase master web (60010)\n\n\nHBase RS (16020)\n\n\nHBase RS info (60030)\n\n\nFalcon (15000)\n\n\nStorm (8744)\n\n\nHive metastore (9083)\n\n\nHive server (10000)\n\n\nHive server HTTP (10001)\n\n\nAccumulo master (9999)\n\n\nAccumulo Tserver (9997)\n\n\nAtlas (21000)\n\n\nKNOX (8443)\n\n\nOozie (11000)\n\n\nSpark HS (18080)\n\n\nNM Web (8042)\n\n\nZeppelin WebSocket (9996)\n\n\nZeppelin UI (9995)\n\n\nKibana (3080)\n\n\nElasticsearch (9200)\n\n\n\n\nCustom Security Group\n\n\nYou can define your own security group by adding all the ports, protocols and CIDR range you'd like to use. The rules\n defined here doesn't need to contain the internal rules, those are automatically added by Cloudbreak to the security\n  group on GCP.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n 443 and 22 ports needs to be there in every security group otherwise Cloudbreak won't be able to communicate with the \nprovisioned cluster\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this security group \ntemplate to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The security groups are created on GCP only after the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nsecurity group template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nDefining cluster services\n\n\nBlueprints\n\n\nBlueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own ones.\nBlueprints can be added from file, URL (an \nexample blueprint\n) or the \nwhole JSON can be written in the \nJSON text\n box.\n\n\nThe host groups in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster. Besides this the services and\n components will also be installed on the corresponding nodes. Blueprints can be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Not necessary to define all the configuration in the blueprint. If a configuration is missing, Ambari will \nfill that with a default value.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to \ncreate clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight \nmodifications.\n\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the \nmodifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations are hardcoded for example domain names, memory configurations...etc. that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster\n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster.\n\n\nHere is a \nbasic flow for cluster creation on Cloudbreak Web UI\n:\n\n\n\n\nStart by selecting a previously created GCP credential in the header.\n\n\nOpen \ncreate cluster\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Cluster\n tab\n\n\n\n\nFill out the new cluster \nname\n\n\nCluster name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character then you can apply lowercase alphanumeric and \n   hyphens only (min 5, max 40 characters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a \nRegion\n where you like your cluster be provisioned\n\n\nClick on the \nSetup Network and Security\n button\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to see the created cluster on\n the UI, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Network and Security\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the networks\n\n\nSelect one of the security groups\n\n\nClick on the \nChoose Blueprint\n button\n\n\nIf \nEnable security\n is checked as well, Cloudbreak will install Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the cluster will \nbe Kerberized. See more about it in the \nKerberos\n section of this documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Blueprint\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the blueprint\n\n\nAfter you've selected a \nBlueprint\n, you should be able to configure:\n\n\nthe templates\n\n\nthe number of nodes for all of the host groups in the blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to select where you want to install the Ambari server to. Only 1 host group can be selected.\n   If you want to install the Ambari server to a separate node, you need to extend your blueprint with a new host group\n   which contains only 1 service: HDFS_CLIENT and select this host group for the Ambari server. Note: this host group cannot be scaled so \n   it is not advised to select a 'slave' host group for this purpose.\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd File System\n button\n\n\n\n\nAdd File System\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the file system that fits your needs\n\n\nAfter you've selected \nGCS file system\n, you should configure:\n\n\nDefault Bucket Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nReview and Launch\n button\n\n\nYou can read more about \nGCS File System\n and \nBucket Naming\n in GCP \nDocumentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview and Launch\n tab\n\n\n\n\nAfter the \ncreate and start cluster\n button has clicked Cloudbreak will start to create the cluster's resources on \n your GCP account.\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak uses \nGoogle Cloud Platform\n to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak\n on the \nCompute Engine\n page of the \nGoogle Compute Platform\n.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nBesides these you can check the progress on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself if you open the new cluster's \nEvent History\n.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nAdvanced options\n\n\nThere are some advanced features when deploying a new cluster, these are the following:\n\n\nAmbari Username\n This user will be used as admin user in Ambari. You can log in using this username on the Ambari UI.\n\n\nAmbari Password\n The password associated with the Ambari username. This password will be also the default password for all required passwords which are not specified in the blueprint. E.g: hive DB password.\n\n\nAvailability Zone\n You can restrict the instances to a \nspecific availability zone\n. It may be useful if you're using\n reserved instances.\n\n\nMinimum cluster size\n The provisioning strategy in case of the cloud provider cannot allocate all the requested nodes.\n\n\nValidate blueprint\n This is selected by default. Cloudbreak validates the Ambari blueprint in this case.\n\n\nShipyard enabled cluster\n This is selected by default. Cloudbreak will start a \nShipyard\n container which helps you to manage your containers.\n\n\nConfig recommendation strategy\n Strategy for configuration recommendations how will be applied. Recommended \nconfigurations gathered by the response of the stack advisor. \n\n\n\n\nNEVER_APPLY\n               Configuration recommendations are ignored with this option.\n\n\nONLY_STACK_DEFAULTS_APPLY\n Applies only on the default configurations for all included services.\n\n\nALWAYS_APPLY\n              Applies on all configuration properties.\n\n\n\n\nCluster termination\n\n\nYou can terminate running or stopped clusters with the \nterminate\n button in the cluster details.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster. If that fails for some reason, try to delete the \nGCP instances first. Instances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an \ninstance manually!\n\n\n\n\nSometimes Cloudbreak cannot synchronize it's state with the cluster state at the cloud provider and the cluster can't\n be terminated. In this case the \nForced termination\n option can help to terminate the cluster at the Cloudbreak \n side. \nIf it has happened:\n\n\n\n\nYou should check the related resources at the Google Cloud Platform\n\n\nIf it is needed you need to manually remove resources from there\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nInteractive mode / Cloudbreak Shell\n\n\nThe goal with the Cloudbreak Shell (Cloudbreak CLI) was to provide an interactive command line tool which supports:\n\n\n\n\nall functionality available through the REST API or Cloudbreak Web UI\n\n\nmakes possible complete automation of management task via scripts\n\n\ncontext aware command availability\n\n\ntab completion\n\n\nrequired/optional parameter support\n\n\nhint command to guide you on the usual path\n\n\n\n\nStart Cloudbreak Shell\n\n\nTo start the Cloudbreak CLI use the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nOpen your \ncloudbreak-deployment\n directory if it is needed. For example:\n\n\n\n\n   cd cloudbreak-deployment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the \ncbd\n from here if it is needed\n\n\n\n\n   cbd start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the root of your \ncloudbreak-deployment\n folder apply:\n\n\n\n\n   cbd util cloudbreak-shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the very first time it will take for a while, because of need to download all the necessary docker images.\n\n\n\n\nThis will launch the Cloudbreak shell inside a Docker container then it is ready to use.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT You have to copy all your files into the \ncbd\n working directory, what you would like to use in shell.\n For \nexample if your \ncbd\n working directory is \n~/cloudbreak-deployment\n then copy your \nblueprint JSON, public ssh key \nfile...etc.\n to here. You can refer to these files with their names from the shell.\n\n\n\n\nAutocomplete and hints\n\n\nCloudbreak Shell helps to you with \nhint messages\n from the very beginning, for example:\n\n\ncloudbreak-shell\nhint\nHint: Add a blueprint with the 'blueprint add' command or select an existing one with 'blueprint select'\ncloudbreak-shell\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond this you can use the \nautocompletion (double-TAB)\n as well:\n\n\ncloudbreak-shell\ncredential create --\ncredential create --AWS          credential create --AZURE        credential create --EC2          credential create --GCP          credential create --OPENSTACK\n\n\n\n\nProvisioning via CLI\n\n\nSetting up GCP credential\n\n\nCloudbreak works by connecting your GCP account through so called Credentials, and then uses these credentials to \ncreate resources on your behalf. Credentials can be configured with the following command for example:\n\n\ncredential create --GCP --description \nsample description\n --name my-gcp-credential --projectId \nyour gcp projectid\n \n--serviceAccountId \nyour GCP service account mail address\n --serviceAccountPrivateKeyPath /files/mykey.p12 \n--sshKeyString \nssh-rsa AAAAB3***etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n that Cloudbreak \ndoes not set your cloud user details\n - we work around the concept of GCP Service \nAccount Credentials. You should have already a valid GCP service account. You can find further details \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives to provide \nSSH Key\n:\n\n\n\n\nyou can upload your public key from an url: \n\u2014sshKeyUrl\n \n\n\nor you can add the path of your public key: \n\u2014sshKeyPath\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether the credential was created successfully\n\n\ncredential list\n\n\n\n\nYou can switch between your existing credentials\n\n\ncredential select --name my-gcp-credential\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure templates\n\n\nAfter your GCP account is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating resource templates that describe your clusters' \ninfrastructure:\n\n\n\n\nsecurity groups\n\n\nnetworks\n\n\ntemplates\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create one of the above resource, \nCloudbreak does not make any requests to GCP. Resources are only created\n on GCP after the \ncluster create\n has applied.\n These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \n reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTemplates describe the \ninstances of your cluster\n - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.\n\n\nA template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a \nnew stack). Templates can be configured with the following command for example:\n\n\ntemplate create --GCP --name my-gcp-template --instanceType n1-standard-2 --volumeCount 2 --volumeSize 100\n\n\n\n\nOther available options here:\n\n\n--volumeType\n The default is \npd-standard\n (HDD), other allowed value is \npd-ssd\n \n(SSD).\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this template \nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the template was created successfully\n\n\ntemplate list\n\n\n\n\nNetworks\n\n\nYour clusters can be created in their own \nnetworks\n or in one of your already existing one. If you choose an \nexisting network, it is possible to create a new subnet within the network. The subnet's IP range must be defined in \nthe \nSubnet (CIDR)\n field using the general CIDR notation. You can read more about \nGCP Networks\n and \nSubnet networks\n.\n\n\nDefault GCP Network\n\n\nIf you don't want to create or use your custom network, you can use the \ndefault-gcp-network\n for all your \nCloudbreak clusters. It will create a new network with a \n10.0.0.0/16\n subnet every time a cluster is created.\n\n\nCustom GCP Network\n\n\nIf you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom network you'll have to apply the following command:\n\n\nnetwork create --GCP --name my-gcp-network --description \nsample description\n\n\n\n\n\nOther available options here:\n\n\n--networkId\n The Virtual Network Identifier of your network. This is an optional \nvalue and must be an ID of an existing GCP virtual network. If the identifier is provided, the subnet CIDR will be \nignored and the existing network's CIDR range will be used.\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template \nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n--subnet\n specified subnet which will be used by the cluster (will be created under the provisioning).\n\n\n--subnetId\n if you have an existing subnet in the network then you can specify the id here and the cluster will use that existing subnet.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Please make sure the defined subnet here doesn't overlap with any of your \nalready deployed subnet in the network, because of the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.\n\n\nIn case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances. The \nprovided subnet CIDR will be ignored, but a proper CIDR range will be used.\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether the network was created successfully\n\n\nnetwork list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The new networks are created on GCP only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nnetwork template.\n\n\n\n\nDefining cluster services\n\n\nBlueprints\n\n\nBlueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own ones.\nBlueprints can be added from file or URL (an \nexample blueprint\n).\n\n\nThe host groups in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster. Besides this the services and\n components will also be installed on the corresponding nodes. Blueprints can be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Not necessary to define all the configuration in the blueprint. If a configuration is missing, Ambari will fill that with a default value.\n\n\n\n\nblueprint add --name my-blueprint --description \nsample description\n --file \nthe path of the blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--url\n the url of the blueprint\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the blueprint was created successfully\n\n\nblueprint list\n\n\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight \nmodifications.\n\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the \nmodifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations are hardcoded for example domain names, memory configurations..etc. that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster.\n\n\nMetadata show\n\n\nYou can check the stack metadata with\n\n\nstack metadata --name myawsstack --instancegroup master\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--id\n In this case you can select a stack with id.\n\n\n--outputType\n In this case you can modify the outputformat of the command (RAW or JSON). \n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster. The following sub-sections show \nyou a \nbasic flow for cluster creation with Cloudbreak Shell\n.\n\n\nSelect credential\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created GCP credential:\n\n\ncredential select --name my-gcp-credential\n\n\n\n\nSelect blueprint\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created blueprint which fits your needs:\n\n\nblueprint select --name multi-node-hdfs-yarn\n\n\n\n\nConfigure instance groups\n\n\nYou must configure instance groups before provisioning. An instance group define a group of nodes with a specified \ntemplate. Usually we create instance groups for host groups in the blueprint. For Ambari server only 1 host group can be specified.\nIf you want to install the Ambari server to a separate node, you need to extend your blueprint with a new host group\nwhich contains only 1 service: HDFS_CLIENT and select this host group for the Ambari server. Note: this host group cannot be scaled so \nit is not advised to select a 'slave' host group for this purpose.\n\n\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup master --nodecount 1 --templateName minviable-aws --ambariServer true\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup slave_1 --nodecount 1 --templateName minviable-aws --ambariServer false\n\n\n\n\nOther available option:\n\n\n--templateId\n Id of the template\n\n\nSelect network\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created network which fits your needs or a default one:\n\n\nnetwork select --name default-gcp-network\n\n\n\n\nSelect security group\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created security which fits your needs or a default one:\n\n\nsecuritygroup select --name all-services-port\n\n\n\n\nCreate stack / Create cloud infrastructure\n\n\nStack means the running cloud infrastructure that is created based on the instance groups configured earlier \n(\ncredential\n, \ninstancegroups\n, \nnetwork\n, \nsecuritygroup\n). Same as in case of the API or UI the new cluster will \nuse your templates and by using GCP will launch your cloud stack. Use the following command to create a \nstack to be used with your Hadoop cluster:\n\n\nstack create --name mygcpstack --region us-central1\n\n\n\n\nThe infrastructure is created asynchronously, the state of the stack can be checked with the stack \nshow command\n. If \nit reports AVAILABLE, it means that the virtual machines and the corresponding infrastructure is running at the cloud provider.\n\n\nOther available option is:\n\n\n--wait\n - in this case the create command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n\nCreate a Hadoop cluster / Cloud provisioning\n\n\nYou are almost done! One more command and your Hadoop cluster is starting!\n Cloud provisioning is done once the \ncluster is up and running. The new cluster will use your selected blueprint and install your custom Hadoop cluster \nwith the selected components and services.\n\n\ncluster create --description \nmy first cluster\n\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--wait\n - in this case the create command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n\nYou are done!\n You have several opportunities to check the progress during the infrastructure creation then \nprovisioning:\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak uses \nGoogle Cloud Platform\n to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by \nCloudbreak on the Compute Engine page of the Google Compute Platform..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf stack then cluster creation have successfully done, you can check the Ambari Web UI. However you need to know the \nAmbari IP (for example: \nhttp://130.211.163.13:8080\n): \n\n\nYou can get the IP from the CLI as a result (\nambariServerIp 130.211.163.13\n) of the following command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         cluster show\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nBesides these you can check the entire progress and the Ambari IP as well on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself. Open the \nnew cluster's \ndetails\n and its \nEvent History\n here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nStop cluster\n\n\nYou have the ability to \nstop your existing stack then its cluster\n if you want to suspend the work on it.\n\n\nSelect a stack for example with its name:\n\n\nstack select --name my-stack\n\n\n\n\nOther available option to define a stack is its \n--id\n.\n\n\nEvery time you should stop the \ncluster\n first then the \nstack\n. So apply following commands to stop the previously \nselected stack:\n\n\ncluster stop\nstack stop\n\n\n\n\nRestart cluster\n\n\nSelect your stack that you would like to restart\n after this you can apply:\n\n\nstack start\n\n\n\n\nAfter the stack has successfully restarted, you can \nrestart the related cluster as well\n:\n\n\ncluster start\n\n\n\n\nUpscale cluster\n\n\nIf you need more instances to your infrastructure, you can \nupscale your selected stack\n:\n\n\nstack node --ADD --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--withClusterUpScale\n - this indicates also a cluster upscale after the stack upscale. You\n can upscale the related cluster separately if you want to do this:\n\n\ncluster node --ADD --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6\n\n\n\n\nDownscale cluster\n\n\nYou also can reduce the number of instances in your infrastructure. \nAfter you selected your stack\n:\n\n\ncluster node --REMOVE  --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--withStackDownScale\n - this indicates also a stack downscale after the cluster downscale.\n You can downscale the related stack separately if you want to do this:\n\n\nstack node --REMOVE  --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2\n\n\n\n\nCluster termination\n\n\nYou can terminate running or stopped clusters with\n\n\nstack terminate --name myawsstack\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--wait\n - in this case the terminate command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster. If that fails for some reason, try to delete the \nCloudFormation stack first. Instances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an instance manually!\n\n\n\n\nSometimes Cloudbreak cannot synchronize it's state with the cluster state at the cloud provider and the cluster can't\n be terminated. In this case the \nForced termination\n option on the Cloudbreak Web UI can help to terminate the cluster\n  at the Cloudbreak side. \nIf it has happened:\n\n\n\n\nYou should check the related resources at the AWS CloudFormation\n\n\nIf it is needed you need to manually remove resources from ther\n\n\n\n\nSilent mode\n\n\nWith Cloudbreak Shell you can execute script files as well. A script file contains shell commands and can \nbe executed with the \nscript\n cloudbreak shell command\n\n\nscript \nyour script file\n\n\n\n\n\nor with the \ncbd util cloudbreak-shell-quiet\n command\n\n\ncbd util cloudbreak-shell-quiet \n example.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n You have to copy all your files into the \ncbd\n working directory, what you would like to use in shell.\n For example if your \ncbd\n working directory is ~/cloudbreak-deployment then copy your script file to here.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following example creates a hadoop cluster with \nhdp-small-default\n blueprint on M3Xlarge instances with 2X100G \nattached disks on \ndefault-gcp-network\n network using \nall-services-port\n security group. You should copy your ssh \npublic key file (with name \nid_rsa.pub\n) and your GCP service account generated private key ( with name \ngcp.p12\n) into your \ncbd\n working \ndirectory and change the \n...\n parts with your GCP credential details.\n\n\ncredential create --GCP --description \nmy credential\n --name my-gcp-credential --projectId \nyour gcp projectid\n --serviceAccountId \nyour GCP service account mail address\n --serviceAccountPrivateKeyPath gcp.p12 --sshKeyFile id_rsa.pub\ncredential select --name my-gcp-credential\ntemplate create --GCP --name gcptemplate --description gcp-template --instanceType n1-standard-4 --volumeSize 100 \n--volumeCount 2\nblueprint select --name hdp-small-default\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_master_1 --nodecount 1 --templateName gcptemplate --ambariServer true\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_master_2 --nodecount 1 --templateName gcptemplate --ambariServer false\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_master_3 --nodecount 1 --templateName gcptemplate --ambariServer false\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_client_1  --nodecount 1 --templateName gcptemplate --ambariServer false\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --nodecount 3 --templateName gcptemplate --ambariServer false\nnetwork select --name default-gcp-network\nsecuritygroup select --name all-services-port\nstack create --GCP --name my-first-stack --region us-central1 --wait true\ncluster create --description \nMy first cluster\n --wait true\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!\n Your cluster should now be up and running on this way as well.

These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be \nreused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.  Templates  Templates describe the  instances of your cluster  - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.  The instance templates can be configured on the  manage templates  panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.  If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create clusters, but cannot delete it  Networks  Your clusters can be created in their own  networks  or in one of your already existing one. If you choose an \nexisting network, it is possible to create a new subnet within the network. The subnet's IP range must be defined in \nthe  Subnet (CIDR)  field using the general CIDR notation. You can read more about  GCP Networks  and  Subnet \nnetworks .  Default GCP Network  If you don't want to create or use your custom network, you can use the  default-gcp-network  for all your \nCloudbreak clusters. It will create a new network with a  10.0.0.0/16  subnet every time a cluster is created.  Custom GCP Network  If you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom network you'll have to  create a new network  template on the  manage \nnetworks  panel.  You have the following options:   Create a new virtual network and a new subnet : Every time a cluster is created with this kind of network setup a new virtual network and a new subnet with the specified IP range will be created for the instances on Google Cloud.  Create a new subnet in an existing virtual network : Use this kind of network setup if you already have a virtual network on Google Cloud where you'd like to put the Cloudbreak created cluster but you'd like to have a separate subnet for it.  Use an existing subnet in an existing virtual network : Use this kind of network setup if you have an existing virtual network with one or more subnets on Google Cloud and you'd like to start the instances of a cluster in one of those subnets.  Use a legacy network without subnets : Use this kind of network setup if you have a legacy virtual network on Google Cloud that doesn't have subnet support and you'd like to start instances in that virtual network directly.    IMPORTANT  Please make sure the defined subnet here doesn't overlap with any of your already deployed subnet in the\n network, because of the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.  In case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances. The \nprovided subnet CIDR will be ignored, but a proper CIDR range will be used.   If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template \nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.   NOTE  The new networks are created on GCP only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nnetwork template.    Full size  here .  Security groups  Security group templates are very similar to the  Firewalls on GCP .  They describe the allowed inbound traffic \nto the instances in the cluster.  Currently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster \nand all the instances have a public IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security \ngroup.

Please open the \nProfile\n file then check the \nPUBLIC_IP\n.\nThis is mandatory, because of to can access the Cloudbreak UI (called Uluwatu). In some cases the \ncbd\n tool tries to\nguess it. If \ncbd\n cannot get the IP address during the initialization, please set the appropriate value.\n\n\nOpenStack specific configuration\n\n\nMake sure that the \nVM image used by Cloudbreak is imported on your OpenStack\n.\n\n\nUsing self-signed certificates\n\n\nIf your OpenStack is secured with a self-signed certificate, you need to import that certificate into Cloudbreak, \nor else Cloudbreak won't be able to communicate with your OpenStack. To import the certificate, place the certificate \nfile in the generated certs directory \n/certs/trusted/\n. The trusted directory does not exist by default, so you need to create it.\nCloudbreak will automatically pick up these certificates and import them into its truststore upon start.\n\n\nStart Cloudbreak Deployer\n\n\nTo start the Cloudbreak application use the following command.\nThis will start all the Docker containers and initialize the application.\n\n\ncbd start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the very first time it will take for a while, because of need to download all the necessary docker images.\n\n\n\n\nThe \ncbd start\n command includes the \ncbd generate\n command which applies the following steps:\n\n\n\n\ncreates the \ndocker-compose.yml\n file that describes the configuration of all the Docker containers needed for the Cloudbreak deployment.\n\n\ncreates the \nuaa.yml\n file that holds the configuration of the identity server used to authenticate users to Cloudbreak.\n\n\n\n\nValidate the started Cloudbreak Deployer\n\n\nAfter the \ncbd start\n command finishes followings are worthy to check:\n\n\n\n\nPre-installed Cloudbreak Deployer version and health.\n\n\n\n\n   cbd doctor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case of \ncbd update\n is needed, please check the related documentation for \nCloudbreak Deployer Update\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarted Cloudbreak Application logs.\n\n\n\n\n   cbd logs cloudbreak\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak should start within a minute - you should see a line like this: \nStarted CloudbreakApplication in 36.823 seconds\n\n\n\n\nProvisioning Prerequisites\n\n\nGenerate a new SSH key\n\n\nAll the instances created by Cloudbreak are configured to allow key-based SSH,\nso you'll need to provide an SSH public key that can be used later to SSH onto the instances in the clusters you'll create with Cloudbreak.\nYou can use one of your existing keys or you can generate a new one.\n\n\nTo generate a new SSH keypair:\n\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \nyour_email@example.com\n\n# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label\n# Generating public/private rsa key pair.\n\n\n\n\n# Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]\nYou'll be asked to enter a passphrase, but you can leave it empty.\n\n# Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]\n# Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\n\n\n\n\nAfter you enter a passphrase the keypair is generated. The output should look something like below.\n\n\n# Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.\n# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\n# The key fingerprint is:\n# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:sd:17:sd:7d:sd:68:9d:sd:a2:sd your_email@example.com\n\n\n\n\nLater you'll need to pass the \n.pub\n file's contents to Cloudbreak and use the private part to SSH to the instances\n\n\nProvisioning via Browser\n\n\nYou can log into the Cloudbreak application at \nhttp://\nPublic_IP\n:3000/\n.\n\n\nThe main goal of the Cloudbreak UI is to easily create clusters on your own cloud provider account.\nThis description details the OpenStack setup - if you'd like to use a different cloud provider check out its manual.\n\n\nThis document explains the four steps that need to be followed to create Cloudbreak clusters from the UI:\n\n\n\n\nconnect your OpenStack account with Cloudbreak\n\n\ncreate some template resources on the UI that describe the infrastructure of your clusters\n\n\ncreate a blueprint that describes the HDP services in your clusters\n\n\nlaunch the cluster itself based on these resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Make sure that you have sufficient qouta (CPU, network, etc) for the requested cluster size\n\n\n\n\nSetting up OpenStack credentials\n\n\nCloudbreak works by connecting your OpenStack account through so called \nCredentials\n, and then uses these credentials\n to create resources on your behalf. The credentials can be configured on the \nmanage credentials\n panel on the \nCloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\nTo create a new OpenStack credential follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \nKeystone Version\n. For instance, select the \nv2\n\n\nFill out the new credential \nName\n\n\nOnly alphanumeric and lowercase characters (min 5, max 100 characters) can be applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy your OpenStack user name to the \nUser\n field\n\n\nCopy your OpenStack user password to the \nPassword\n field\n\n\nCopy your OpenStack tenant name to the \nTenant Name\n field\n\n\nCopy your OpenStack identity service (Keystone) endpoint (e.g. http://PUBLIC_IP:5000/v2.0) to the \nEndpoint\n field\n\n\nCopy your SSH public key to the \nSSH public key\n field\n\n\nThe SSH public key must be in OpenSSH format and it's private keypair can be used later to \nSSH onto every \ninstance\n of every cluster you'll create with this credential.\n\n\nThe \nSSH username\n for the OpenStack instances is \ncloudbreak\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny other parameter is optional here. You can read more about Keystone v3 \nhere\n.\n\n\nAPI Facing\n is the URL perspective in which the API is accessing data.\n\n\nPublic in account\n means that all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this credential to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nInfrastructure templates\n\n\nAfter your OpenStack account is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating resource templates that describe your \nclusters' infrastructure:\n\n\n\n\ntemplates\n\n\nnetworks\n\n\nsecurity groups\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create one of the above resource, \nCloudbreak does not make any requests to OpenStack. Resources are only \ncreated on OpenStack after the \ncreate cluster\n button has pushed.\n These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's \ndatabase and can be reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTemplates describe the \ninstances of your cluster\n - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.\n\n\nThe instance templates can be configured on the \nmanage templates\n panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nNetworks\n\n\nYour clusters can be created in their own \nnetworks\n or in one of your already existing one. If you choose an\nexisting network, it is possible to create a new subnet within the network. The subnet's IP range must be defined in\nthe \nSubnet (CIDR)\n field using the general CIDR notation. Here you can read more about \nOpenStack networking\n.\n\n\nCustom OpenStack Network\n\n\nIf you'd like to deploy a cluster to your OpenStack network you'll have to \ncreate a new network\n template on the\n\nmanage networks\n panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\"Before launching an instance, you must create the necessary virtual network infrastructure...an instance uses a\npublic provider virtual network that connects to the physical network infrastructure...This network includes a DHCP\nserver that provides IP addresses to instances...The admin or other privileged user must create this network because\nit connects directly to the physical network infrastructure.\"\n\n\nHere you can read more about OpenStack \nvirtual network\n and \npublic provider network\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou have the following options to create a new network:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new network and a new subnet\n: Every time a cluster is created with this kind of network setup a new network and a new subnet with the specified IP range will be created for the instances on OpenStack.\n\n\nCreate a new subnet in an existing network\n: Use this kind of network setup if you already have a network on OpenStack where you'd like to put the Cloudbreak created cluster but you'd like to have a separate subnet for it.\n\n\nUse an existing subnet in an existing network\n: Use this kind of network setup if you have an existing network with one or more subnets on OpenStack and you'd like to start the instances of a cluster in one of those subnets.\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the parameters:\n\n\n\n\nName\n the name of the new network\n\n\nLength must be between 5 and 100 characters\n\n\nStarts with a lowercase alphabetic character\n\n\nCan contain lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubnet (CIDR)\n With this field you define the IP address space usable by your VMs within the cluster. Cloudbreak supports the private address space defined in \nRFC1918\n. E.g. you can use 10.0.0.0/24\n\n\nFloating Pool ID\n \nFloating IPs\n  are not automatically allocated to instances by default, they needs to be attached to instances after creation. The Floating IPs are used to provide access to your VMs running on OpenStack. You can figure out the available network pools and their IDs by using the \nnova floating-ip-pool-list\n and \nneutron net-external-list\n or copy-pasting it from OpenStack Horizon UI. Such networks have the \nExternal Network\n field set to \nYes\n. If you are unable to find the ID then just consult with your OpenStack network administrator. Please note that if you do not set this field then your cluster might not be accessible.\n\n\nVirtual Network Identifier\n This is the ID of an existing virtual network on OpenStack where you would like to launch the cluster. (Must be provided for \nCreate a new subnet in an existing network\n and \nUse an existing subnet in an existing network\n)\n\n\nRouter Identifier\n Specify the router ID that shall interconnect your existing Network with the Subnet which will be created by CLoudbreak. (Must be provided for \nCreate a new subnet in an existing network\n).\n\n\nSubnet Identifier\n This is the ID of an existing subnet on OpenStack where you would like to launch the cluster. (Must be provided for \nUse an existing subnet in an existing network\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Please make sure the defined subnet here doesn't overlap with any of your already deployed subnet in the\n network, because of the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.\n\n\nIn case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances. The\nprovided subnet CIDR will be ignored, but a proper CIDR range will be used.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template\nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The new networks are created on OpenStack only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected\nnetwork template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nSecurity groups\n\n\nSecurity group templates are very similar to the \nSecurity Groups on OpenStack\n. \nThey describe the allowed inbound traffic \nto the instances in the cluster.\n Currently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster \nand all the instances have a public IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security \ngroup. This may change in a later release.\n\n\nDefault Security Group\n\n\nYou can also use the two pre-defined security groups in Cloudbreak.\n\n\nonly-ssh-and-ssl:\n all ports are locked down except for SSH and the selected Ambari Server HTTPS (you can't access Hadoop services \noutside of the network):\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nHTTPS (443)\n\n\n\n\nall-services-port:\n all Hadoop services, SSH and HTTPS are accessible by default:\n\n\n\n\nSSH (22)\n\n\nHTTPS (443)\n\n\nAmbari (8080)\n\n\nConsul (8500)\n\n\nNN (50070)\n\n\nRM Web (8088)\n\n\nScheduler (8030RM)\n\n\nIPC (8050RM)\n\n\nJob history server (19888)\n\n\nHBase master (60000)\n\n\nHBase master web (60010)\n\n\nHBase RS (16020)\n\n\nHBase RS info (60030)\n\n\nFalcon (15000)\n\n\nStorm (8744)\n\n\nHive metastore (9083)\n\n\nHive server (10000)\n\n\nHive server HTTP (10001)\n\n\nAccumulo master (9999)\n\n\nAccumulo Tserver (9997)\n\n\nAtlas (21000)\n\n\nKNOX (8443)\n\n\nOozie (11000)\n\n\nSpark HS (18080)\n\n\nNM Web (8042)\n\n\nZeppelin WebSocket (9996)\n\n\nZeppelin UI (9995)\n\n\nKibana (3080)\n\n\nElasticsearch (9200)\n\n\n\n\nCustom Security Group\n\n\nYou can define your own security group by adding all the ports, protocols and CIDR range you'd like to use. The rules\n defined here doesn't need to contain the internal rules, those are automatically added by Cloudbreak to the security\n  group on OpenStack.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n 443 and 22 ports needs to be there in every security group otherwise Cloudbreak won't be able to communicate with the \nprovisioned cluster\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this security group \ntemplate to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The security groups are created on OpenStack only after the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nsecurity group template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n/sub\n\n\nDefining cluster services\n\n\nBlueprints\n\n\nBlueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own ones.\nBlueprints can be added from file, URL (an \nexample blueprint\n) or the \nwhole JSON can be written in the \nJSON text\n box.\n\n\nThe host groups in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster. Besides this the services and\n components will also be installed on the corresponding nodes. Blueprints can be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Not necessary to define all the configuration in the blueprint. If a configuration is missing, Ambari will \nfill that with a default value.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to \ncreate clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight \nmodifications.\n\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the \nmodifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations are hardcoded for example domain names, memory configurations...etc. that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster\n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster.\n\n\nHere is a \nbasic flow for cluster creation on Cloudbreak Web UI\n:\n\n\n\n\nStart by selecting a previously created OpenStack credential in the header.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nOpen \ncreate cluster\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Cluster\n tab\n\n\n\n\nFill out the new cluster \nname\n\n\nThe name must be between 5 and 40 characters long and must satisfy the followings:\n\n\nStarts with a lowercase alphabetic character\n\n\nCan contain lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of your \nRegion\n where you like your cluster be provisioned\n\n\nClick on the \nSetup Network and Security\n button\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to see the created cluster on\n the UI, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Network and Security\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created networks\n\n\nSelect one of the security groups\n\n\nClick on the \nChoose Blueprint\n button\n\n\nIf \nEnable security\n is checked as well, Cloudbreak will install Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the cluster will \nbe Kerberized.

Only 1 host group can be selected.\n   If you want to install the Ambari server to a separate node, you need to extend your blueprint with a new host group\n   which contains only 1 service: HDFS_CLIENT and select this host group for the Ambari server. Note: this host group cannot be scaled so \n   it is not advised to select a 'slave' host group for this purpose.\n\n\nClick on the \nReview and Launch\n button\n\n\n\n\nReview and Launch\n tab\n\n\n\n\nAfter the \ncreate and start cluster\n button has clicked Cloudbreak will start to create the cluster's resources on \n your OpenStack account.\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak uses \nOpenStack\n to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak\n on the \nInstances\n page of your OpenStack \nProject\n.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nBesides these you can check the progress on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself if you open the new cluster's \nEvent History\n.\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nAdvanced options\n\n\nAmbari Username\n This user will be used as admin user in Ambari. You can log in using this username on the Ambari UI.\n\n\nAmbari Password\n The password associated with the Ambari username. This password will be also the default password for all required passwords which are not specified in the blueprint. E.g: hive DB password.\n\n\nConnector Variant\n Cloudbreak provides two implementation for creating OpenStack cluster\n\n\n\n\nHEAT\n using \nHEAT\n template to create the resources\n\n\nNATIVE\n using API calls to create the resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HEAT variant utilizes the Heat templating to launch a stack, but the NATIVE variant starts the cluster\n  by using a sequence of API calls without Heat to achieve the same result, although both of them are using the same \n  authentication and credential management.\n\n\n\n\nMinimum cluster size\n The provisioning strategy in case of the cloud provider cannot allocate all the requested nodes.\n\n\nValidate blueprint\n This is selected by default. Cloudbreak validates the Ambari blueprint in this case.\n\n\nShipyard enabled cluster\n This is selected by default. Cloudbreak will start a \nShipyard\n container which helps you to manage your containers.\n\n\nConfig recommendation strategy\n Strategy for configuration recommendations how will be applied. Recommended \nconfigurations gathered by the response of the stack advisor. \n\n\n\n\nNEVER_APPLY\n               Configuration recommendations are ignored with this option.\n\n\nONLY_STACK_DEFAULTS_APPLY\n Applies only on the default configurations for all included services.\n\n\nALWAYS_APPLY\n              Applies on all configuration properties.\n\n\n\n\nCluster termination\n\n\nYou can terminate running or stopped clusters with the \nterminate\n button in the cluster details.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster. If that fails for some reason, try to delete the \nOpenStack instances first. Instances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an \ninstance manually!\n\n\n\n\nSometimes Cloudbreak cannot synchronize it's state with the cluster state at the cloud provider and the cluster can't\n be terminated. In this case the \nForced termination\n option can help to terminate the cluster at the Cloudbreak \n side. \nIf it has happened:\n\n\n\n\nYou should check the related resources at the OpenStack\n\n\nIf it is needed you need to manually remove resources from there\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n/sub\n\n\nInteractive mode / Cloudbreak Shell\n\n\nThe goal with the Cloudbreak Shell (Cloudbreak CLI) was to provide an interactive command line tool which supports:\n\n\n\n\nall functionality available through the REST API or Cloudbreak Web UI\n\n\nmakes possible complete automation of management task via scripts\n\n\ncontext aware command availability\n\n\ntab completion\n\n\nrequired/optional parameter support\n\n\nhint command to guide you on the usual path\n\n\n\n\nStart Cloudbreak Shell\n\n\nTo start the Cloudbreak CLI use the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nOpen your \ncloudbreak-deployment\n directory if it is needed.

You can refer to these files with their names from the shell.\n\n\n\n\nAutocomplete and hints\n\n\nCloudbreak Shell helps to you with \nhint messages\n from the very beginning, for example:\n\n\ncloudbreak-shell\nhint\nHint: Add a blueprint with the 'blueprint add' command or select an existing one with 'blueprint select'\ncloudbreak-shell\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond this you can use the \nautocompletion (double-TAB)\n as well:\n\n\ncloudbreak-shell\ncredential create --\ncredential create --AWS          credential create --AZURE        credential create --EC2          credential create --GCP          credential create --OPENSTACK\n\n\n\n\nProvisioning via CLI\n\n\nSetting up OpenStack credential\n\n\nCloudbreak works by connecting your OpenStack account through so called Credentials, and then uses these credentials to \ncreate resources on your behalf. Credentials can be configured with the following command for example:\n\n\ncredential create --OPENSTACK --name my-os-credential --description \nsample description\n --userName \nOpenStack username\n --password \nOpenStack password\n --tenantName \nOpenStack tenant name\n --endPoint \nOpenStack Identity Service (Keystone) endpoint\n --sshKeyString \nssh-rsa AAAAB****etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n that Cloudbreak \ndoes not set your cloud user details\n - we work around the concept of \nOpenStack's \nauthentication\n. You should have already valid OpenStack credentials. You can \nfind further details \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives to provide \nSSH Key\n:\n\n\n\n\nyou can upload your public key from an url: \n\u2014sshKeyUrl\n \n\n\nor you can add the path of your public key: \n\u2014sshKeyPath\n\n\n\n\nOther available option:\n\n\n--facing\n URL perspective in which the API is accessing data, allowed types are: public, admin and internal.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n If facing not specified OpenStack default value will be applied.\n\n\n\n\nYou can check whether the credential was created successfully\n\n\ncredential list\n\n\n\n\nYou can switch between your existing credentials\n\n\ncredential select --name my-os-credential\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure templates\n\n\nAfter your OpenStack account is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating resource templates that describe your \nclusters' infrastructure:\n\n\n\n\nsecurity groups\n\n\nnetworks\n\n\ntemplates\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create one of the above resource, \nCloudbreak does not make any requests to OpenStack. Resources are only \ncreated on OpenStack after the \ncluster create\n has applied.\n These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and\n can be reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTemplates describe the \ninstances of your cluster\n - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.\n\n\nA template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a \nnew stack). Templates can be configured with the following command for example:\n\n\ntemplate create --OPENSTACK --name my-os-template --description \nsample description\n --instanceType m1.medium \n--volumeSize 100 --volumeCount 1\n\n\n\n\nOther available option here is \n--publicInAccount\n. If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able\n to use this template to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the template was created successfully\n\n\ntemplate list\n\n\n\n\nNetworks\n\n\nYour clusters can be created in their own \nnetworks\n or in one of your already existing one. If you choose an \nexisting network, it is possible to create a new subnet within the network. The subnet's IP range must be defined in \nthe \nSubnet (CIDR)\n field using the general CIDR notation. Here you can read more about \nOpenStack networking\n.\n\n\nCustom OpenStack Network\n\n\nIf you'd like to deploy a cluster to your OpenStack network you'll have to \ncreate a new network\n template.\n\n\nA network also can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to \nstart a new stack).\n\n\n\n\n\"Before launching an instance, you must create the necessary virtual network infrastructure...an instance uses a \npublic provider virtual network that connects to the physical network infrastructure...This network includes a DHCP \nserver that provides IP addresses to instances...The admin or other privileged user must create this network because \nit connects directly to the physical network infrastructure.\"\n\n\nHere you can read more about OpenStack \nvirtual network\n and \npublic provider network\n.\n\n\n\n\nnetwork create --OPENSTACK --name my-os-network --description openstack-network --publicNetID \nid of an OpenStack \npublic network\n --subnet 10.0.0.0/16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\n\n\n\nIn case of existing subnet all three parameters must be provided, with new subnet only two are required.\n\n\nPlease make sure the defined subnet here doesn't overlap with any of your already deployed subnet in the\n network, because of the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.\n\n\nIn case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances. The \nprovided subnet CIDR will be ignored, but a proper CIDR range will be used.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The new networks are created on OpenStack only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected \nnetwork template.\n\n\n\n\nOther available options here:\n\n\n--networkId\n This must be an ID of an existing OpenStack virtual network.\n\n\n--routerId\n Your virtual network router ID (must be provided in case of existing virtual network).\n\n\n--subnetId\n Your subnet ID within your virtual network. If the identifier is provided, the \nSubnet \n(CIDR)\n will be ignored. Leave it blank if you'd like to create a new subnet within the virtual network with the \nprovided \nSubnet (CIDR)\n range.\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this template to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the network was created successfully\n\n\nnetwork list\n\n\n\n\nDefining cluster services\n\n\nBlueprints\n\n\nBlueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own ones.\nBlueprints can be added from file or URL (an \nexample blueprint\n).\n\n\nThe host groups in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster. Besides this the services and\n components will also be installed on the corresponding nodes. Blueprints can be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Not necessary to define all the configuration in the blueprint. If a configuration is missing, Ambari will fill that with a default value.\n\n\n\n\nblueprint add --name my-blueprint --description \nsample description\n --file \nthe path of the blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--url\n the url of the blueprint\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n If it is true, all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nYou can check whether the blueprint was created successfully\n\n\nblueprint list\n\n\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight \nmodifications.\n\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the \nmodifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations are hardcoded for example domain names, memory configurations..etc. that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster.\n\n\nMetadata show\n\n\nYou can check the stack metadata with\n\n\nstack metadata --name myawsstack --instancegroup master\n\n\n\n\nOther available options:\n\n\n--id\n In this case you can select a stack with id.\n\n\n--outputType\n In this case you can modify the outputformat of the command (RAW or JSON). \n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster. The following sub-sections show \nyou a \nbasic flow for cluster creation with Cloudbreak Shell\n.\n\n\nSelect credential\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created OpenStack credential:\n\n\ncredential select --name my-os-credential\n\n\n\n\nSelect blueprint\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created blueprint which fits your needs:\n\n\nblueprint select --name multi-node-hdfs-yarn\n\n\n\n\nConfigure instance groups\n\n\nYou must configure instance groups before provisioning. An instance group define a group of nodes with a specified \ntemplate. Usually we create instance groups for host groups in the blueprint. For Ambari server only 1 host group can be specified.\nIf you want to install the Ambari server to a separate node, you need to extend your blueprint with a new host group\nwhich contains only 1 service: HDFS_CLIENT and select this host group for the Ambari server. Note: this host group cannot be scaled so \nit is not advised to select a 'slave' host group for this purpose.\n\n\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup master --nodecount 1 --templateName minviable-aws --ambariServer true\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup slave_1 --nodecount 1 --templateName minviable-aws --ambariServer false\n\n\n\n\nOther available option:\n\n\n--templateId\n Id of the template\n\n\nSelect network\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created network which fits your needs or a default one:\n\n\nnetwork select --name my-os-network\n\n\n\n\nSelect security group\n\n\nSelect one of your previously created security which fits your needs or a default one:\n\n\nsecuritygroup select --name all-services-port\n\n\n\n\nCreate stack / Create cloud infrastructure\n\n\nStack means the running cloud infrastructure that is created based on the instance groups configured earlier \n(\ncredential\n, \ninstancegroups\n, \nnetwork\n, \nsecuritygroup\n). Same as in case of the API or UI the new cluster will \nuse your templates and by using OpenStack will launch your cloud stack. Use the following command to create a \nstack to be used with your Hadoop cluster:\n\n\nstack create --name myosstack --region local\n\n\n\n\nThe infrastructure is created asynchronously, the state of the stack can be checked with the stack \nshow command\n. If \nit reports AVAILABLE, it means that the virtual machines and the corresponding infrastructure is running at the cloud provider.\n\n\nOther available option is:\n\n\n--wait\n - in this case the create command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n\nCreate a Hadoop cluster / Cloud provisioning\n\n\nYou are almost done! One more command and your Hadoop cluster is starting!\n Cloud provisioning is done once the \ncluster is up and running. The new cluster will use your selected blueprint and install your custom Hadoop cluster \nwith the selected components and services.\n\n\ncluster create --description \nmy first cluster\n\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--wait\n - in this case the create command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n\nYou are done!\n You have several opportunities to check the progress during the infrastructure creation then \nprovisioning:\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak uses \nOpenStack\n to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak on\n the OpenStack Console Instances page.\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf stack then cluster creation have successfully done, you can check the Ambari Web UI. However you need to know the \nAmbari IP (for example: \nhttp://172.16.252.59:8080\n): \n\n\nYou can get the IP from the CLI as a result (\nambariServerIp 172.16.252.59\n) of the following command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         cluster show\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nBesides these you can check the entire progress and the Ambari IP as well on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself. Open the \nnew cluster's \ndetails\n and its \nEvent History\n here.\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nStop cluster\n\n\nYou have the ability to \nstop your existing stack then its cluster\n if you want to suspend the work on it.\n\n\nSelect a stack for example with its name:\n\n\nstack select --name my-stack\n\n\n\n\nOther available option to define a stack is its \n--id\n.\n\n\nEvery time you should stop the \ncluster\n first then the \nstack\n. So apply following commands to stop the previously \nselected stack:\n\n\ncluster stop\nstack stop\n\n\n\n\nRestart cluster\n\n\nSelect your stack that you would like to restart\n after this you can apply:\n\n\nstack start\n\n\n\n\nAfter the stack has successfully restarted, you can \nrestart the related cluster as well\n:\n\n\ncluster start\n\n\n\n\nUpscale cluster\n\n\nIf you need more instances to your infrastructure, you can \nupscale your selected stack\n:\n\n\nstack node --ADD --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--withClusterUpScale\n - this indicates also a cluster upscale after the stack upscale. You\n can upscale the related cluster separately if you want to do this:\n\n\ncluster node --ADD --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6\n\n\n\n\nDownscale cluster\n\n\nYou also can reduce the number of instances in your infrastructure. \nAfter you selected your stack\n:\n\n\ncluster node --REMOVE  --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--withStackDownScale\n - this indicates also a stack downscale after the cluster downscale.\n You can downscale the related stack separately if you want to do this:\n\n\nstack node --REMOVE  --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2\n\n\n\n\nCluster termination\n\n\nYou can terminate running or stopped clusters with\n\n\nstack terminate --name myawsstack\n\n\n\n\nOther available option is \n--wait\n - in this case the terminate command will return only after the process has finished. \n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster. If that fails for some reason, try to delete the \nCloudFormation stack first. Instances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an instance manually!\n\n\n\n\nSometimes Cloudbreak cannot synchronize it's state with the cluster state at the cloud provider and the cluster can't\n be terminated. In this case the \nForced termination\n option on the Cloudbreak Web UI can help to terminate the cluster\n  at the Cloudbreak side. \nIf it has happened:\n\n\n\n\nYou should check the related resources at the AWS CloudFormation\n\n\nIf it is needed you need to manually remove resources from ther\n\n\n\n\nSilent mode\n\n\nWith Cloudbreak Shell you can execute script files as well. A script file contains shell commands and can \nbe executed with the \nscript\n cloudbreak shell command\n\n\nscript \nyour script file\n\n\n\n\n\nor with the \ncbd util cloudbreak-shell-quiet\n command\n\n\ncbd util cloudbreak-shell-quiet \n example.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n You have to copy all your files into the \ncbd\n working directory, what you would like to use in shell.\n For example if your \ncbd\n working directory is ~/cloudbreak-deployment then copy your script file to here.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following example creates a hadoop cluster with \nhdp-small-default\n blueprint on \nm1.large\n instances with 2X100G\n attached disks on \nosnetwork\n network using \nall-services-port\n security group. You should copy your ssh public key \n file into your \ncbd\n working directory with name \nid_rsa.pub\n and change the \n...\n parts with your OpenStack \n credential and network details.\n\n\ncredential create --OPENSTACK --name my-os-credential --description \ncredentail description\n --userName \nOpenStack username\n --password \nOpenStack password\n --tenantName \nOpenStack tenant name\n --endPoint \nOpenStack Identity Service (Keystone) endpoint\n --sshKeyPath \npath of your public SSH key file\n\ncredential select --name my-os-credential\ntemplate create --OPENSTACK --name ostemplate --description openstack-template --instanceType m1.large --volumeSize 100 --volumeCount 2\nblueprint select --name hdp-small-default\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_master_1 --nodecount 1 --templateName ostemplate --ambariServer true\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_master_2 --nodecount 1 --templateName ostemplate --ambariServer false\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_master_3 --nodecount 1 --templateName ostemplate --ambariServer false\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_client_1  --nodecount 1 --templateName ostemplate --ambariServer false\ninstancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --nodecount 3 --templateName ostemplate --ambariServer false\nnetwork create --OPENSTACK --name osnetwork --description openstack-network --publicNetID \nid of an OpenStack public network\n --subnet 10.0.0.0/16\nnetwork select --name osnetwork\nsecuritygroup select --name all-services-port\nstack create --OPENSTACK --name my-first-stack --region local --wait true\ncluster create --description \nMy first cluster\n --wait true\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!\n Your cluster should now be up and running on this way as well.

Resources are only \ncreated on OpenStack after the  create cluster  button has pushed.  These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's \ndatabase and can be reused with multiple clusters to describe the infrastructure.  Templates  Templates describe the  instances of your cluster  - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is\n to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple\n large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.  The instance templates can be configured on the  manage templates  panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.  If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create clusters, but cannot delete it.  Networks  Your clusters can be created in their own  networks  or in one of your already existing one. If you choose an\nexisting network, it is possible to create a new subnet within the network. The subnet's IP range must be defined in\nthe  Subnet (CIDR)  field using the general CIDR notation. Here you can read more about  OpenStack networking .  Custom OpenStack Network  If you'd like to deploy a cluster to your OpenStack network you'll have to  create a new network  template on the manage networks  panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.   \"Before launching an instance, you must create the necessary virtual network infrastructure...an instance uses a\npublic provider virtual network that connects to the physical network infrastructure...This network includes a DHCP\nserver that provides IP addresses to instances...The admin or other privileged user must create this network because\nit connects directly to the physical network infrastructure.\"  Here you can read more about OpenStack  virtual network  and  public provider network .   You have the following options to create a new network:   Create a new network and a new subnet : Every time a cluster is created with this kind of network setup a new network and a new subnet with the specified IP range will be created for the instances on OpenStack.  Create a new subnet in an existing network : Use this kind of network setup if you already have a network on OpenStack where you'd like to put the Cloudbreak created cluster but you'd like to have a separate subnet for it.  Use an existing subnet in an existing network : Use this kind of network setup if you have an existing network with one or more subnets on OpenStack and you'd like to start the instances of a cluster in one of those subnets.   Explanation of the parameters:   Name  the name of the new network  Length must be between 5 and 100 characters  Starts with a lowercase alphabetic character  Can contain lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only    Subnet (CIDR)  With this field you define the IP address space usable by your VMs within the cluster. Cloudbreak supports the private address space defined in  RFC1918 . E.g. you can use 10.0.0.0/24  Floating Pool ID   Floating IPs   are not automatically allocated to instances by default, they needs to be attached to instances after creation. The Floating IPs are used to provide access to your VMs running on OpenStack. You can figure out the available network pools and their IDs by using the  nova floating-ip-pool-list  and  neutron net-external-list  or copy-pasting it from OpenStack Horizon UI. Such networks have the  External Network  field set to  Yes . If you are unable to find the ID then just consult with your OpenStack network administrator. Please note that if you do not set this field then your cluster might not be accessible.  Virtual Network Identifier  This is the ID of an existing virtual network on OpenStack where you would like to launch the cluster. (Must be provided for  Create a new subnet in an existing network  and  Use an existing subnet in an existing network )  Router Identifier  Specify the router ID that shall interconnect your existing Network with the Subnet which will be created by CLoudbreak. (Must be provided for  Create a new subnet in an existing network ).  Subnet Identifier  This is the ID of an existing subnet on OpenStack where you would like to launch the cluster. (Must be provided for  Use an existing subnet in an existing network )    IMPORTANT  Please make sure the defined subnet here doesn't overlap with any of your already deployed subnet in the\n network, because of the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.  In case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances. The\nprovided subnet CIDR will be ignored, but a proper CIDR range will be used.   If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template\nto create clusters, but cannot delete it.   NOTE  The new networks are created on OpenStack only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected\nnetwork template.    Full size  here .  Security groups  Security group templates are very similar to the  Security Groups on OpenStack .  They describe the allowed inbound traffic \nto the instances in the cluster.  Currently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster \nand all the instances have a public IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security \ngroup. This may change in a later release.

You have several opportunities to check the progress during the infrastructure creation then \nprovisioning:   Cloudbreak uses  OpenStack  to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak on\n the OpenStack Console Instances page.   For example:  Full size  here .   If stack then cluster creation have successfully done, you can check the Ambari Web UI. However you need to know the \nAmbari IP (for example:  http://172.16.252.59:8080 ):   You can get the IP from the CLI as a result ( ambariServerIp 172.16.252.59 ) of the following command:              cluster show  For example:  Full size  here .   Besides these you can check the entire progress and the Ambari IP as well on the Cloudbreak Web UI itself. Open the \nnew cluster's  details  and its  Event History  here.   For example:  Full size  here .  Stop cluster  You have the ability to  stop your existing stack then its cluster  if you want to suspend the work on it.  Select a stack for example with its name:  stack select --name my-stack  Other available option to define a stack is its  --id .  Every time you should stop the  cluster  first then the  stack . So apply following commands to stop the previously \nselected stack:  cluster stop\nstack stop  Restart cluster  Select your stack that you would like to restart  after this you can apply:  stack start  After the stack has successfully restarted, you can  restart the related cluster as well :  cluster start  Upscale cluster  If you need more instances to your infrastructure, you can  upscale your selected stack :  stack node --ADD --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6  Other available option is  --withClusterUpScale  - this indicates also a cluster upscale after the stack upscale. You\n can upscale the related cluster separately if you want to do this:  cluster node --ADD --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6  Downscale cluster  You also can reduce the number of instances in your infrastructure.  After you selected your stack :  cluster node --REMOVE  --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2  Other available option is  --withStackDownScale  - this indicates also a stack downscale after the cluster downscale.\n You can downscale the related stack separately if you want to do this:  stack node --REMOVE  --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2",

            "text": "Mesos introduction\n\n\n\n\nMesos support is currently \nTECHNICAL PREVIEW\n. It may not be suitable for production use.\n\n\n\n\nThe basic concepts of Cloudbreak's Mesos support are the same as the other other cloud provider implementations: HDP clusters will be provisioned through Ambari with the help of blueprints and Ambari server and agents run in Docker containers. But it has a lot of major differences, and to start working with Cloudbreak on Mesos these differences must be understood first.\n\n\nDifferences with the cloud provider implementations\n\n\n1. The Mesos integration doesn't start new instances and doesn't build a new infrastructure on a cloud provider.\n\n\nCloudbreak's normal behavior is to build the infrastructure first where Hadoop components will be deployed later through Ambari. It involves creating or reusing the networking layer like virtual networks and subnets, provisioning new virtual machines in these networks from pre-existing cloud images and starting the Ambari docker containers on these nodes. Mesos integration was designed \nnot\n to include these steps because in most cases users already have their own Mesos infrastructure and would like to deploy their cluster there, near their other components. That's why Cloudbreak expects to \"bring your own Mesos infrastructure\" and configure access to this Mesos deployment in Cloudbreak first.\n\n\n2. A Mesos credential on the Cloudbreak UI means configuring access to the Marathon API.\n\n\nCloudbreak needs a control system in Mesos through which it can communicate and start Ambari containers. The standard application scheduling framework for services in Mesos is Marathon so we've chosen it as the solution for Cloudbreak. It means that to be able to communicate with Mesos, Cloudbreak needs a Marathon deployment on the Mesos cluster. When setting up access in Cloudbreak a Marathon API endpoint must be specified. Basic authentication and TLS on the Marathon API is not yet supported in the tech preview.\n\n\n3. A Mesos template on the Cloudbreak UI means constraints instead of new resources.\n\n\nCloudbreak templates describe the virtual machines in a cluster's hostgroup that will be provisioned through the cloud provider API. Templates can be created on the UI for Mesos and they can be linked to a hostgroup as well but these templates mean resource constraints that will be demanded through the Marathon API instead of resources that will created. \nExample:\n\n\n\n\nAn AWS template with an instance type of \nm4.large\n and 4 pieces of 50 GB attached magnetic volumes will create a VM with these specs when Cloudbreak is building the cluster infrastructure.\n\n\nA Mesos template with 2 CPU cores and 4 GB memory means that Cloudbreak will request the Marathon API to schedule the Ambari container on a node where these resources can be satisfied\n\n\n\n\n4. Cloudbreak doesn't start a gateway instance.\n\n\nOn the cloud providers there is a gateway VM that's deployed for every new cluster by Cloudbreak. It runs a few containers like Ambari server but most importantly runs an Nginx server. Every communication between a Cloudbreak deployment and a cluster deployed by Cloudbreak goes through this Nginx instance. This is done on a 2-way TLS channel where the Nginx server is responsible for the TLS termination. Communication inside the cluster, like between Ambari server and agents is not encrypted but every communication from outside is secure. It enables Cloudbreak to be deployed outside of the private network of the cluster. The Mesos integration doesn't have a solution like this, so every communication between Cloudbreak and the cluster goes through an unencrypted channel. This is one of the reasons that in this case Cloudbreak should be deployed inside the same private network (or in the same Mesos cluster) where the clusters will be deployed.\n\n\nTechnical Preview Restrictions\n\n\n1. No out-of-the-box dns solution like Consul.\n\n\nIn case of Mesos Cloudbreak does not provide a custom DNS solution like on other cloud providers, where Consul is used to provide addresses for every node and some services like Ambari server. In the Mesos tech preview containers are deployed with \nnet=host\n, and Mesos nodes must be set up manually in a way to be able to resolve each other's hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa with reserve DNS. This is a requirement of Hadoop and it is usually accomplished by setting up the \n/etc/hosts\n file on each node in the cluster, but it can also be provided by some DNS servers like Amazon's default DNS server in a virtual network.\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nthere are 5 nodes in the Mesos cluster: \nnode1, node2, node3, node4 and node5\n with IP addresses of \n10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.5\n respectively.\n\n\nthe \n/etc/hosts\n file on \nnode1\n should contain these entries:\n\n\n\n\n    10.0.0.2 node2\n    10.0.0.3 node3\n    10.0.0.4 node4\n    10.0.0.5 node5\n\n\n\n\n2. Cloudbreak must be able to resolve the addresses of the Mesos slaves.\n\n\nCloudbreak must be able to communicate with the Ambari server that's deployed in the Mesos cluster to make the API requests needed for example to create a cluster. After Cloudbreak instructs Marathon to deploy the Ambari server container somewhere in the Mesos cluster it asks the address of the node where it was deployed and will try to communicate with the Ambari server through the address that was returned by Marathon. Take for example a Mesos cluster with 5 registered nodes: \nnode1, node2, node3, node4, node5\n:\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak makes a \nPOST\n request to the Marathon API to deploy the Ambari server container somewhere with enough resources.\n\n\nThe Ambari server container is started on \nnode4\n. The node address is returned to Cloudbreak.\n\n\nCloudbreak tries to access \nnode4:8080\n to check if Ambari is running.\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the lack of a gateway node, communication is unencrypted between Cloudbreak and the clusters, so it is suggested that Cloudbreak should be deployed in the same private network. In that case the above scenario is probably not a problem.\nIf Cloudbreak is not in the same network this can be solved by adding the addresses with a reachable IP in the \n/etc/hosts\n file of the machine where Cloudbreak is deployed.\n\n\n3. Storage management needs to be improved\n\n\nThis is one of the two biggest limitations of the current Mesos integration. There is no specific volume management in the current integration, which means that data is stored inside the Docker containers. This solution has a lot of problems that will be solved only in later releases:\n\n\n\n\nData will only be stored on those volumes where Docker is installed (probably the root volume), attached volumes are not used\n\n\nAfter the container is destroyed the data is destroyed as well\n\n\nNo data locality\n\n\n\n\n4. IP-per-task is not supported yet\n\n\nThe other big limitation of the current integration is the lack of IP-per-task support. Currently containers are deployed with \nnet=host\n which means that only one container can be deployed per Mesos host because of possible port collisions, and that is the case even with multiple clusters.\nIP-per-task means that every task of an app (all the containers) deployed through Marathon will get their own network interface and an IP address.\n\nThis feature\n is already available in Mesos/Marathon but does not work in combination with Docker containers.\n\n\n5. Recipes are not supported\n\n\nRecipes are script extensions to an HDP cluster installation supported by Cloudbreak, but it is not supported with the Mesos integration because of the lack of a Consul deployment as this feature is heavily dependent on Consul's HTTP API.\n\n\nCloudbreak deployer\n\n\nCloudbreak Deployer Highlights\n\n\n\n\nAll \ncbd\n actions must be executed from the \ncbd\n root folder.\n\n\nMost of the \ncbd\n commands require \nroot\n permissions. So it would be worth if you apply \nsudo su\n.\n\n\n\n\nSetup Cloudbreak Deployer\n\n\nFirst you should \ninstall the Cloudbreak Deployer\n manually on a VM inside your Mesos cluster's private network.\n\n\nIf you have your own installed VM, you should check the \nInitialize your Profile\n \nsection here before starting the provisioning.\n\n\nOpen the \ncloudbreak-deployment\n directory:\n\n\ncd cloudbreak-deployment\n\n\n\n\nThis is the directory of the configuration files and the supporting binaries for Cloudbreak Deployer.\n\n\nInitialize your Profile\n\n\nFirst initialize \ncbd\n by creating a \nProfile\n file:\n\n\ncbd init\n\n\n\n\nIt will create a \nProfile\n file in the current directory. Please open the \nProfile\n file then check the \nPUBLIC_IP\n. \nThis is mandatory, because it is used to access the Cloudbreak UI. In some cases the \ncbd\n tool tries to \nguess it. If \ncbd\n cannot get the IP address during the initialization, please set the appropriate value.\n\n\nStart Cloudbreak Deployer\n\n\nTo start the Cloudbreak application use the following command.\nThis will start all the Docker containers and initialize the application.\n\n\ncbd start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the very first time it will take for a while, because it will need to download all the necessary docker images.\n\n\n\n\nThe \ncbd start\n command includes the \ncbd generate\n command which applies the following steps:\n\n\n\n\ncreates the \ndocker-compose.yml\n file that describes the configuration of all the Docker containers needed for the Cloudbreak deployment.\n\n\ncreates the \nuaa.yml\n file that holds the configuration of the identity server used to authenticate users to Cloudbreak.\n\n\n\n\nValidate the started Cloudbreak Deployer\n\n\nAfter the \ncbd start\n command finishes followings are worth to check:\n\n\n\n\nPre-installed Cloudbreak Deployer version and health.\n\n\n\n\n   cbd doctor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case of \ncbd update\n is needed, please check the related documentation for \nCloudbreak Deployer Update\n. Most of the \ncbd\n commands require \nroot\n permissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogs of the Cloudbreak Application:\n\n\n\n\n   cbd logs cloudbreak\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudbreak should start within a minute - you should see a line like this: `Started CloudbreakApplication in 36.823 seconds\n\n\n\n\nProvisioning Prerequisites\n\n\nA working Mesos cluster with Marathon\n\n\nIt is not the scope of Cloudbreak to provision a new Mesos cluster so it needs an already working Mesos cluster where it will be able to start HDP clusters. It is also required to have Marathon installed because Cloudbreak uses its API to schedule Docker containers.\n\n\nHostnames must be resolvable inside the Mesos cluster and also by Cloudbreak\n\n\nCloudbreak does not deploy a custom DNS solution like on other cloud providers, where Consul is used to provide addresses for every node. Containers are deployed with \nnet=host\n and Mesos nodes must be set up manually in a way to be able to resolve each other's hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa with reserve DNS. This is a requirement of Hadoop and it is usually accomplished by setting up the \n/etc/hosts\n file on each node in the cluster, but it can also be provided by some DNS servers like Amazon's default DNS server in a virtual network.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nIf you have 5 nodes in the Mesos cluster: \nnode1, node2, node3, node4 and node5\n with private IP addresses of \n10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.5\n respectively, the \n/etc/hosts\n file on \nnode1\n should contain these entries:\n\n\n\n\n    10.0.0.2 node2\n    10.0.0.3 node3\n    10.0.0.4 node4\n    10.0.0.5 node5\n\n\n\n\nDocker must be installed on Mesos slave nodes and Docker containerizer must be enabled\n\n\nTo be able to use the Docker containerizer, Docker must be installed on all the Mesos slave nodes. To install Docker, follow the instructions in their documentation \nhere\n.\n\n\nAfter Docker is installed, it can be configured for the Mesos slave, by adding the \nDocker containerizer\n to each Mesos slave configuration. To configure it, add \ndocker,mesos\n to the file \n/etc/mesos-slave/containerizers\n on each of the slave nodes (or start mesos-slave with the \n--containerizers=mesos,docker\n flag, or set the environment variable MESOS_CONTAINERIZERS=\"mesos,docker\"). You may also want to increase the executor timeout to 10 mins by adding \n10mins\n to \n/etc/mesos-slave/executor_registration_timeout\n because it will allow time for pulling large Docker images.\n\n\nProvisioning via Browser\n\n\nYou can log into the Cloudbreak application at \nhttp://\nPUBLIC_IP\n:3000\n.\n\n\nThe main goal of the Cloudbreak UI is to easily create clusters on your own cloud provider, or on your existing Mesos cluster.\nThis description details the Mesos setup - if you'd like to use a different cloud provider check out its manual.\n\n\nThis document explains the four steps that need to be followed to create Cloudbreak clusters from the UI:\n\n\n\n\nconnect your Marathon API with Cloudbreak\n\n\ncreate some resource constraints on the UI that describe the resources needed by your cluster\n\n\ncreate a blueprint that describes the HDP services in your clusters\n\n\nlaunch the cluster itself based on the resource constraints and the HDP blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Make sure that you have sufficient quota (CPU, memory) in your Mesos cluster for the requested cluster size.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up Marathon credentials\n\n\nCloudbreak works by connecting your Marathon API through so called \nCredentials\n, and then uses the API to schedule containers on your Mesos cluster. The credentials can be configured on the \nmanage credentials\n panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.\n\n\nTo create a new Marathon credential follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nFill out the new credential \nName\n\n\nOnly alphanumeric and lowercase characters (min 5, max 100 characters) can be applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd an optional description\n\n\nSpecify the endpoint of your Marathon API in this format: \nhttp://\nmarathon-address\n:\nport\n. Example: \nhttp://172.16.252.31:8080\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic in account\n means that all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this credential to create \nclusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication and HTTPS to a Marathon API is not yet supported by Cloudbreak\n\n\nResource constraints\n\n\nAfter your Marathon API is linked to Cloudbreak you can start creating resource constraint templates that describe the resources requested through the Marathon API when starting an Ambari container.\n\n\nWhen you create a resource constraint template, \nCloudbreak does not make any requests to Marathon. Resources are only requested after the \ncreate cluster\n button was pushed and Cloudbreak starts to orchestrate containers.\n These templates are saved to Cloudbreak's database and can be reused with multiple clusters to describe the same resource constraints.\n\n\nA typical setup is to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to request more memory for Spark nodes.\n\n\nThe resource contraint templates can be configured on the \nmanage templates\n panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard under the Mesos tab. You can specify the memory, CPU and disk needed by the nodes in a hostgroup. If \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nDefining cluster services\n\n\nBlueprints\n\n\nBlueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster. These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own ones.\nBlueprints can be added from file, URL (an \nexample blueprint\n) or the \nwhole JSON can be written in the \nJSON text\n box.\n\n\nThe host groups in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster. Besides this the services and\n components will also be installed on the corresponding nodes. Blueprints can be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Not necessary to define all the configuration in the blueprint. If a configuration is missing, Ambari will \nfill that with a default value.\n\n\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to \ncreate clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\nFull size \nhere\n.\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight \nmodifications.\n\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the \nmodifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations are hardcoded for example domain names, memory configurations...etc. that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster\n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the cluster resources are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster.\n\n\nHere is a \nbasic flow for cluster creation on Cloudbreak's Web UI\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart by selecting a previously created Mesos credential in the header.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \ncreate cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Cluster\n tab\n\n\n\n\nFill out the new cluster \nname\n\n\nCluster name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character then you can apply lowercase alphanumeric and \n   hyphens only (min 5, max 40 characters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nChoose Blueprint\n button\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to see the created cluster on\n the UI, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Blueprint\n tab\n\n\n\n\nSelect one of the blueprints\n\n\nAfter you've selected a \nBlueprint\n, you should be able to configure:\n\n\nthe resource constraints\n\n\nthe number of nodes for all of the host groups in the blueprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nReview and Launch\n button\n\n\n\n\nReview and Launch\n tab\n\n\n\n\nAfter the \ncreate and start cluster\n button was clicked Cloudbreak will start to orchestrate the Ambari containers through your Marathon API.\n\n\n\n\nYou can check the progress on the Cloudbreak Web UI if you open the new cluster's \nEvent History\n. It is available if you click on the cluster's name.\n\n\nAdvanced options\n\n\nThere are some advanced features when deploying a new cluster, these are the following:\n\n\nValidate blueprint\n This is selected by default. Cloudbreak validates the Ambari blueprint in this case.\n\n\nConfig recommendation strategy\n Strategy for configuration recommendations how will be applied. Recommended \nconfigurations gathered by the response of the stack advisor. \n\n\n\n\nNEVER_APPLY\n               Configuration recommendations are ignored with this option.\n\n\nONLY_STACK_DEFAULTS_APPLY\n Applies only on the default configurations for all included services.\n\n\nALWAYS_APPLY\n              Applies on all configuration properties\n\n\n\n\nCluster termination\n\n\nYou can terminate running or stopped clusters with the \nterminate\n button in the cluster details.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n Always use Cloudbreak to terminate the cluster instead of deleting the containers through the Marathon API. Deleting them first would cause inconsistencies between Cloudbreak's database and the real state and that could lead to errors",

This directory must be created outside of the cloned Cloudbreak git repository:\n\n\nmkdir cbd-local\n\n\n\n\nTo start the complete Cloudbreak ecosystem on your machine just execute the following sequence of commands:\n\n\ncd cbd-local\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-deployer/master/install | sh \n cbd --version\ncbd update master\ncbd init\ncbd start\n\n\n\n\nIf everything went well then the Cloudbreak will be available on http://192.168.59.103:3000. For more details and config parameters please check the documentation of \nCloudbreak Deployer\n.\n\n\nThe deployer has generated a \ncerts\n directory under \ncbd-local\n directory which will be needed later on to set up the IDEA properly.\n\n\nThe next step is to edit the \ncbd-local/Profile\n file with any editor and add the CB_SCHEMA_SCRIPTS_LOCATION environment variable which configures the location of SQL scripts that are in the 'core/src/main/resources/schema' directory in the cloned Cloudbreak git repository. Please note that the full path needs to be configured and env variables like $USER cannot be used.\n\n\nexport CB_SCHEMA_SCRIPTS_LOCATION=/Users/myusername/prj/cloudbreak/core/src/main/resources/schema\n\n\n\n\nIn order to kill Cloudbreak container running inside the boot2docker and redirect the Cloudbreak related traffic to the Cloudbreak running in IDEA use the followig command:\n\n\ncbd util local-dev\n\n\n\n\nIDEA\n\n\nCloudbreak can be imported into IDEA as gradle project. Once it is done, you need to import the proper code formatter by using the \nFile -\n Import Settings...\n menu and selecting the \nidea_settings.jar\n located in the \nconfig\n directory in Cloudbreak git repository.\n\n\nTo launch the Cloudbreak application execute the \ncom.sequenceiq.cloudbreak.CloudbreakApplication\n class with VM options:\n\n\n-XX:MaxPermSize=1024m\n-Dcb.cert.dir=FULL_PATH_OF_THE_CERTS_DIR_GENERATED_BY_CBD\n-Dcb.client.id=cloudbreak\n-Dcb.client.secret=cbsecret2015\n-Dcb.db.port.5432.tcp.addr=192.168.59.103\n-Dcb.db.port.5432.tcp.port=5432\n-Dspring.cloud.consul.host=192.168.59.103\n-Dcb.identity.server.url=http://192.168.59.103:8089\n-Dserver.port=9091\n\n\n\n\nThe \n-Dcb.cert.dir=FULL_PATH_OF_THE_CERTS_DIR_GENERATED_BY_CBD\n value above needs to be replaced with the full path of \ncerts\n directory generated by Cloudbreak Deployer e.g. \n-Dcb.cert.dir=/Users/myusername/prj/cbd-local/certs\n\n\nCommand line\n\n\nTo run Cloudbreak from command line you have to create a property file, for example \napplication.properties\n, with the content below, and execute \njava -jar -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -Dspring.config.location=file:///path/of/property/application.properties core/build/libs/cloudbreak.jar\n command at project root. Important that the path of \napplication.properties\n must be an absolute path.\n\n\ncb.cert.dir=FULL_PATH_OF_THE_CERTS_DIR_GENERATED_BY_CBD\ncb.client.id=cloudbreak\ncb.client.secret=cbsecret2015\ncb.db.port.5432.tcp.addr=192.168.59.103\ncb.db.port.5432.tcp.port=5432\nspring.cloud.consul.host=192.168.59.103\ncb.identity.server.url=http://192.168.59.103:8089\nserver.port=9091\n\n\n\n\nDatabase development\n\n\nIf schema change is required in Cloudbreak database (cbdb), then the developer needs to write SQL scripts to migrate the database accordingly. In Cloudbreak the schema migration is managed by \nMYBATIS Migrations\n and the cbd tool provides an easy-to-use wrapper for it. The syntax for using the migration commands is \ncbd migrate \ndatabase name\n \ncommand\n [parameters]\n e.g. \ncbd migrate migrate status\n.\n\n\nCreate a SQL template for schema changes:\n\n\ncbd migrate cbdb new \nCLOUD-123 schema change for new feature\n\n\n\n\n\nAs as result of the above command an SQL file template is generated under the path specified in \nCB_SCHEMA_SCRIPTS_LOCATION\n environment variable, which is defined in Profile. The structure of the generated SQL template looks like the following:\n\n\n-- // CLOUD-123 schema change for new feature\n-- Migration SQL that makes the change goes here.\n\n\n\n-- //@UNDO\n-- SQL to undo the change goes here.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have implemented your SQLs then you can execute them with:\n\n\ncbd migrate cbdb up\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to rollback the last SQL file, then just use the down command:\n\n\ncbd migrate cbdb down\n\n\n\n\nOn order to check the status of database\n\n\ncbd migrate cbdb status\n\n#Every script that has not been executed will be marked as ...pending... in the output of status command:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- MyBatis Migrations - status\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nID             Applied At          Description\n================================================================================\n20150421140021 2015-07-08 10:04:28 create changelog\n20150421150000 2015-07-08 10:04:28 CLOUD-607 create baseline schema\n20150507121756 2015-07-08 10:04:28 CLOUD-576 change instancegrouptype hostgroup to core\n20151008090632    ...pending...

Simplest way to prepare the working environment is to start the Cloudbreak on your local machine is to use the  Cloudbreak Deployer .  First you need to create a  sandbox  directory which will store the necessary  configuration files and dependencies of  Cloudbreak Deployer . This directory must be created outside of the cloned Cloudbreak git repository:  mkdir cbd-local  To start the complete Cloudbreak ecosystem on your machine just execute the following sequence of commands:  cd cbd-local\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-deployer/master/install | sh   cbd --version\ncbd update master\ncbd init\ncbd start  If everything went well then the Cloudbreak will be available on http://192.168.59.103:3000. For more details and config parameters please check the documentation of  Cloudbreak Deployer .  The deployer has generated a  certs  directory under  cbd-local  directory which will be needed later on to set up the IDEA properly.  The next step is to edit the  cbd-local/Profile  file with any editor and add the CB_SCHEMA_SCRIPTS_LOCATION environment variable which configures the location of SQL scripts that are in the 'core/src/main/resources/schema' directory in the cloned Cloudbreak git repository. Please note that the full path needs to be configured and env variables like $USER cannot be used.  export CB_SCHEMA_SCRIPTS_LOCATION=/Users/myusername/prj/cloudbreak/core/src/main/resources/schema  In order to kill Cloudbreak container running inside the boot2docker and redirect the Cloudbreak related traffic to the Cloudbreak running in IDEA use the followig command:  cbd util local-dev",
