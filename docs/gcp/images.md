We have pre-built Cloudbreak Deployer cloud image for Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can launch the latest Cloudbreak Deployer image at the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

> As an alternative to using the pre-built cloud images for GCP, you can install Cloudbreak Deployer on your own VM. For more information, see the [installation instructions](onprem.md).

## Prerequisites

#### Ports 

Make sure that you have opened the following ports on your [Security Group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html):
 
 * SSH (22)
 * Cloudbreak API (8080)
 * Identity server (8089)
 * Cloudbreak UI (3000)
 * User authentication (3001)

## Cloudbreak Deployer GCP Image Details

## Import Cloudbreak Deployer Image

Import the latest Cloudbreak Deployer image on the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) with the help
 of the [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-shell/docs/).
 
To open the Google Cloud Shell, click on the `Activate Google Cloud Shell` icon in the top right corner of the page:

Next, create your own Cloudbreak Deployer instance from the imported image on the Google Developers Console.

> Images are global resources, so you can use them across zones and projects.

When selecting an instance type, consider these minimum and recomended requirements:  

- 4GB RAM, 10GB disk, 2 cores
- The minimum instance type suitable for Cloudbreak is **n1-standard-2**
