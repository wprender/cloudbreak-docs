We have pre-built cloud images for OpenStack with the Cloudbreak Deployer pre-installed and with Cloudbreak 
pre-installed. Following steps will guide you through the launch of the images then the needed configuration.

> Alternatively, instead of using the pre-built cloud image, you can install Cloudbreak Deployer on your own VM. See
 [install the Cloudbreak Deployer](onprem.md) for more information.

 * SSH (22)
 * Cloudbreak API (8080)
 * Identity server (8089)
